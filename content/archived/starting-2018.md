## Starting 2018

It's that time of year when everyone starts to reflect on the previous year and set goals for the current one. In the spirit of jumping on bandwagons this is my note to self. I have been doing some thinking over the last few weeks and have tried to indentify some things I would like to learn and particpate in this year.

## Looking back 

2017 was a massive year for me, I began my journey into professional development and had my first child, couple that with my last year of school and things get pretty crazy. 

That's not to say I haven't enjoyed the journey, but there where certainly some testing times.

Some note worthy things I achieved last year: 

* Parenthood
* Started a local meet up group that as of writing this has close to 120 members
* Completed my core classes
* Started a job as a professional developer

## Looking forward

In many ways I feel like I have just started, I'm over the hill of learning and staring at the mountain named `beyond beginner`. This is where the real tests sit.At work I have to make and fix products that 1000's of people depend on. Elsewhere beginners ask me the questions now and I have to give them my best answer, despite still having many questions myself. I don't think the learning ever stops.

This year I would like to Explore: 

* Data Science
* Blockchain
* Data Structures and Algorithms.
* Programming Concepts and ideas.

I would also like to: 

* Eat well
* Exercise more
* Spend more time with family

This is really me sitting down and listing best case scenarios, things to strive for, things that are worth the effort.

I think putting this online will make me a little more accountable and hopefully get me through the times when I want to give up.

## Challenge and Goal Setting

I will be giving myself little challenges that I will post here and that give me more direction in achieving my longterm goals.

## First Challenge

Last year I couldn't help but notice the `100 days of code` trends popping up on social media, I thought it was  great idea and would definatly help with getting into the habit of coding everyday.

In my case that is something already do, but there are other things I could be doing. So I will be setting myself the `100 days of learning` challenge. I will learn one new thing a day, and report on it here. I'm using my lunch breaks as a time block for this so I will doing it each week day M - F. Wish me luck! :).
