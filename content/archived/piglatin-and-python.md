Back when I was a kid pig latin made no sense. I wanted to make a basic pig latin translator so if I ever come across it again I can at least hold a conversation....

I know this little script will be very handy. 

<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@harps116/piglatin-translator?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

It's pretty amazing that we can read stuff even though the letters are mixed, I'm relying on this ability with the translation back to english. There must be a better way, but going from pig latin to english was a little tricky. 

This is something I did for fun based of an assignment given in [this](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_l28HAzKy0N8) lecture series, the instructor wanted an english to pig latin translator ( in Scheme ) so this was a little exercise to see what I could come up with in python, as I continue to learn the syntax and the 'pythonic' ways.
