### Back to basics

As I've found myself getting deeper into the world of JavaScript it's hard not to take notice of the vast amount of frameworks available to the would be developer. It's actually a little overwhelming at first. Still being relatively fresh to the world  programming and web development in JavaScript, trying to pick a lane is tough.

While I can appreciate that this trend is good sign that the JavaScript eco system will only continue to floursih into the future, there's a part of me that wants to wrestle with the just JavaScript (Vanilla JS if you're hip). There's merit to understanding the base language and it's features to help understand what leg work the frameworks are doing.

### Let's try something

I decided to have a go at toggling classes based on a button click event. Although simple this was a good test of knowledge of the syntax and made me reacess a few things as I typed, the JavaScript is heavily commented to show how everything is working:


<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="dWEPWN" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="harps116" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="dancing blocks in plain ol' JS." class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/dWEPWN/">dancing blocks in plain ol' JS.</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href="https://codepen.io/harps116">@harps116</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

What could a website ever need or want more than dancing blocks?
