## Adam Harpur

Hi, I'm Adam Harpur, a problem solver, currently building and maintaining modern web applications with a focus on usability, performance, and accessibility, improving developer experience with modern DevOps approaches and best in class dev tooling!

Nothing gives me more satisfaction than creating a tool that solves a problem for someone in the real world.

That's what it's all about, How do we as people make these machines serve a purpose. How do we express a solution through code and beyond.

I often have moments of great uncertainty and I firmly believe there's tons more I have to learn, I hope that feeling never goes away.

### Work

I have a broad range of experience developing web applications, covering all aspects of the design and development process across the stack from database to UI.

Working with rapid growth start-ups and fast paced product focused work environments. This is my little slice of the web to put down some thoughts and learn as I go.

### Personal

Outside of programming, I enjoy exercise, travelling and anything that gets me into a flow state of mind 🏌️🏄‍♂️🪁🪘. Currently living and working from Belfast, having previously resided in Australia 🇦🇺 and the U.S.A 🇺🇸.

This blog is minimal reincarnation of my previous works and posts, all of which have been ported over and [archived](https://adam.harpur.io/archive).

Keeping things as simple as possible and reducing the noise to help keep a focus on the content.✌️
