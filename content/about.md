## Adam Harpur

Hi, I am Adam Harpur, a programmer/product developer,

Nothing gives me more satisfaction than creating a tool that solves a problem for someone in the real world.
That's what it's all about. How do we as people make these machines serve a purpose. How we tell our story
through code and beyond.

Working with rapid growth start-ups and fast paced product focused work environments. This is my little slice of the web to put down some thoughts and learn as I go.

Outside of programming, I enjoy exercise, travelling and anything that get's me into a flow state of mind.

This blog is minimal reincarnation of my previous works and posts, all of which have been ported over and [archived](https://adam.harpur.io/archive).

Keeping things as simple as possible and reducing the noise to help keep a focus on the content.
