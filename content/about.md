## me

My name is Adam Harpur and I am a programmer working and living in Belfast, Ireland. 

Nothing gives me more satisfaction than creating a tool that solves a problem for someone in the real world.
That's what it's all about. How do we as people make these machines serve a purpose. How we tell our story
through code and beyond.

In May 2018, I graduated with high honors from Western Technical College, Wisconsin USA, with an Associates in Applied Science with a focus on web and software development and design. I have worked in the industry since 2016.

Working with emerging rapid growth start-ups and thriving fast paced product focused work envrionments. This is my little slice of the web to write put down some thoughts and learn as I go.

## blog

This blog is minimal reincarnation of my previous works and posts, all of which have been ported over and [archived](https://adam.harpur.io/archive).

Keeping things as simple as possible and reducing the noise to help keep a focus on the content.
