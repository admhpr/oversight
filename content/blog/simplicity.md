### Minimise implicit inputs and outputs

Implicit inputs are all of the inputs that aren’t arguments. And implicit outputs are all of the outputs that aren’t the return value.

A function with implicit inputs and outputs is like a component hardwired to other components. It’s not modular. It can’t be used in another place. And its behavior depends on the behavior 
of the parts it’s connected to.
