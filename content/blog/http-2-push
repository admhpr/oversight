HTTP in a normal request, the client makes a call to an endpoint and it waits for a single response. 

It's a one-to-one exchange, you request a thing and het back a thing.

The premise behind HTTP/2 (or H2 as it is sometimes referred to) is that the initial request is not closed after getting back the thing that was requested.

HTTP 1.1 which is typically what we are using in the standard thing for thing exchange has been around since 1996. 

Many sites are using it today and it is still completely valid and a legitimite option.

[SPDY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY), a protocol (now obsolete) protocol developed by Google, made HTTP faster in many ways. 

Slowly the major browsers began to ship SPDY until it became the natural succcesor to HTTP 1.1 after nearly 20 years (2015).

HTTP/2 was ratified as an offical standard of HTTP. It added many new features including:

* Multiplex requests,  meaning you can send many individual messages over a single connection. 
  With 1.1 we had to do a whole new connection with headers, handshakes, security, etc. for every single request. 
  With 2, you can reuse the same connection for multiple things. (Think about the performance win here for big streaming sites like Netflix)

* Better compression strategies. Finer grain access to the underlying data frames. 

* Request prioritisation. You can now request images last and css first.
