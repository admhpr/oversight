### SOLID, an oldie but a goodie

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change". 

As much as you want to add everything and the kitchen sink to a class, don't, it may be "easier" now, but it certainly won't be later. Having many reasons to change a group of functionality reduces [cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)). Minimizing the amount of time you need to change a class is important. It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify a piece of it, it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other dependent modules in your codebase.
