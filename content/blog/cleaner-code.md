### Make your code as readable, code is for humans!

* Use long, descriptive names
* Divide the code into logical subroutines
* Keep it simple when possible - there are no points for complicated one liner solutions

### The creation cycle

* Make it work
* Make it right
* Make it beautiful and fast

### Spend a lot of time reading and understanding a complex piece of code you might be interacting with

* Jumping to code when you do not understand what's happening around will almost always result in an inefficient solution

### Use debuggers extensively.

* Understand input fast: put a break point, play around with methods on your input
* Sandbox: Quickly implement a solution in the watch/console section instead of rerunning the whole program
* Debug: Understand the state of the program and fix it up

### Write tests

* It's better to fail early and fix the problem than fail in production.
* Every time you refactor, change, or add to your code, your tests will make sure you did not regress.
* Add tests at every opportunity
