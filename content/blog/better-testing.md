### Separation of Concerns

* Avoid mixing UI logic with business logic
* UI components should render data, avoid adding logic to UI

An example...

The spec:

> A wiget costs $0.60. If you buy over 50, you get a 20% discount. 

Imagine we had a tightly coupled piece of code that looked like this: 

```js
const $widgetCount = $('#widget-count')
$widgetCount.change((event) => {
  const amount = parseInt (event.target.value)
  const totalCost = 0.6 * amount
  const $price = $("#price")
  if (amount > 50) {
    $price.value(totalCost * 0.8)
  } else {
    $price.value(totalCost)
  }
})
```

It is hard to tell where the UI ends and the business logic starts, let's look at a possible refactor:

```js
const $widgetCount = $('#resistors-count')
const widgetPrice = 0.6

funcrion applyDiscount(sum){
  return sum * 0.8
}

function widgetCost(price, amount) {
  const sum = price * amount
  return amount > 50 ? applyDiscount(sum) : sum
}

$widgetCount.change((event) => {
  const amount = parseInt (event.target.value)
  $("#price").value = widgetCost(widgetPrice, amount)
})
```
Now, you can see where the business logic ends and the UI begins - they are literally separated in two different functions.
