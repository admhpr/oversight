### Manage complexity

>  The biggest problem in the development and maintenance of large-scale software systems is complexity — large systems are hard to understand.


The threads of complexity...

> The major contributor to this complexity in many systems is the handling of state and the burden that this adds when trying to analyse and reason about the system. Other closely related contributors are code volume, and explicit concern with the flow of control through the system.
