It's been a while since I wrote some things down, my focus has shifted and I have my eye on new topics and ideas.

Day to day going through major growth in my day job, the last 18 months or so have changed me as a professional dramatically.

Next areas of focus:

* AWS serverless architecture
* 3D theory
* System design
* Rust & WASM
* Testing

This areas of focus are going to be my main focus for the next few months, by writing them down I hope I can be a little more accountable for what I am learning and writing about. I would like to continue to explore some additional ideas using JS, TS and Node. I have a strong competency in JavaScript and I would like to continue on that path to mastery.

Short and sweet.
