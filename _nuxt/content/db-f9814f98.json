Adapter\n\n## Type: Structural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nMake interfaces compatable\n\n## Variants\n\n### \n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.\n \nReal World Example:\n\n> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter. Another example would be the famous power adapter a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet. Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> The Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nLet's say we had made a game called `Lion Hunter` now our marketing manager loves a good scandal and knows a game like this will generate a lot of social media attention. So we write some code:\n\n```ts\ninterface ILion { \n    roar()\n}\n\nclass AfricanLion implements ILion { \n    roar() { \n        console.log('rooarrr!')\n    }\n}\n\nclass AsianLion implements ILion { \n    public roar() { \n        console.log('roawwwr!')\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow we have a couple of lions, now let's create the hunter:\n\n```ts\ninterface IHunter { \n    hunt(lion : ILion)\n}\n\nclass Hunter implements IHunter { \n    public hunt(lion: ILion) { \n        lion.roar()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt's all working and our PM is very happy...but marketing comes back and says we need more sweet animals to kill, maybe dogs or something...\n\n\nRather than mess with the hunter set up we can make an adapter that uses the already established interface like so:\n\n\n```ts\ninterface IWildDog { \n    bark()\n}\n\nclass WildDog implements IWildDog {\n    public bark() {\n        console.log('bark! bark!')\n    }\n}\n\nclass WildDogAdapter implements ILion {;\n\n    constructor(protected dog: WildDog){\n    }\n\n    public roar(){\n        this.dog.bark();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```ts\nconst wildDog = new WildDog();\nconst wildDogAdapter = new WildDogAdapter(wildDog);\nconst lion = new AfricanLion()\n\nconst hunter = new Hunter();\nhunter.hunt(lion)\nhunter.hunt(wildDogAdapter);\n```\n\nFull Example:\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/8psnf49z/8/embed/js,result/\"></script>\n\n","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/adapter-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890077840},"$loki":3},{"slug":"bridge-pattern","title":"The Bridge Pattern","date":"2018-04-12T17:05","desc":"The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to \"decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently\"","published":true,"taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["design patterns","structural"]},"twitterenable":true,"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"musicalbumenabled":false,"productenabled":false,"product":{"ratingValue":2.5},"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"facebookenable":true,"toc":[{"id":"name-bridge","depth":2,"text":"Name: Bridge"},{"id":"type-structural","depth":2,"text":"Type: Structural"},{"id":"use-when-you-want-to","depth":2,"text":"Use when you want to:"},{"id":"variants","depth":2,"text":"Variants"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"name-bridge"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#name-bridge","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Name: Bridge"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"type-structural"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#type-structural","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Type: Structural"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"use-when-you-want-to"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#use-when-you-want-to","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Use when you want to:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Handle orthogonal (\"Changing A does not change B\") concerns separately.

What would you do? Create multiple copies of each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate theme and load them based on the user's preferences? Bridge pattern allows you to do the second.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> Bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance. Implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy.\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nThe webpage:\n\n```ts\n\ninterface IWebPage {\n    theme: Theme;\n    getContent();\n}\n\n\nclass About implements IWebPage{ \n    constructor(public theme) {\n        this.theme = theme\n    }\n    \n    getContent() {\n        return \"About page in \" + this.theme.getColor()\n    }\n}\n\nclass Careers implements IWebPage{\n   constructor(public theme) {\n       this.theme = theme\n   }\n   \n   getContent() {\n       return \"Careers page in \" + this.theme.getColor()\n   } \n}\n```\n\nAnd the separate theme hierarchy,\n\n```ts\ninterface Theme {\n    getColor();\n}\n\nclass DarkTheme implements Theme{\n    getColor(){\n        return 'Dark Black';\n    }\n}\nclass LightTheme implements Theme{\n    getColor(){\n        return 'Off white';\n    }\n}\nclass AquaTheme implements Theme{\n    getColor(){\n        return 'Light blue';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```ts\nconst darkTheme = new DarkTheme();\n\nconst about = new About(darkTheme);\nconst careers = new Careers(darkTheme);\n\nconsole.log(about.getContent()); // \"About page in Dark Black\";\nconsole.log(careers.getContent()); // \"Careers page in Dark Black\";\n\n```\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/vsp3kdL1/11/embed/js,result/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/bridge-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890077865},"$loki":4},{"slug":"builder-pattern","title":"The Builder Pattern","date":"2018-12-31T00:00","desc":"The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor** anti-pattern.","taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["design patterns","creational"]},"twitterenable":true,"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"musicalbumenabled":false,"productenabled":false,"product":{"ratingValue":2.5},"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"facebookenable":true,"toc":[{"id":"name-builder","depth":2,"text":"Name: Builder"},{"id":"type-creational","depth":2,"text":"Type: Creational"},{"id":"use-when-you-want-to","depth":2,"text":"Use when you want to:"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"name-builder"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#name-builder","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Name: Builder"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"type-creational"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#type-creational","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Type: Creational"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"use-when-you-want-to"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#use-when-you-want-to","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Use when you want to:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"do lots of things to build an object"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"design classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"From Wikipedia:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor** anti-pattern."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Real World Example:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Imagine you are at your local sandwhich place.

You could just order a premade and call it good. Not having to answer any questions about how you would like it made.\nBut what if you wanted some things on there. What bread you would like? If you want tomato? The builder pattern aims to provide this type of customisation of objects.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.\n\n<hr/>\n** A quick note on the telescoping constructor. \n\nExample: \n\n```\nenum BreadTypes { \n    wheat,\n    rye,\n    white,\n    oat\n}\n\nclass Sandwhich{\n\t// constructor is telescoping\n\tconstructor(breadType: BreadTypes, size: number, cheese = true, lettuce = true, tomato = false) {\n    \t\t// instantiation logic\n\t}\n}\n```\nWhen a constructor takes a large number of parameters which become increasing difficult to understand as the number of parameters grow.\nThis is considered an anit-pattern and should be avoided. The builder pattern is one way to solve this.\n\n\n<hr/>\n\nBack to the builder... \n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\n```ts\nenum BreadTypes { \n    wheat,\n    rye,\n    white,\n    oat\n}\n\nclass Sandwhich{\n\tconstructor(builder : SandwhichBuilder) {\n    \t\t// ... \n\t}\n}\n\nclass SandwhichBuilder{\n\n    public cheese: boolean;\n    public tomato: boolean;\n\n\n    constructor(public breadType: BreadTypes) { \n\n    }\n\n    addCheese(): this { \n        this.cheese = true;\n        return this\n    }\n\n    addTomato(): this { \n        this.tomato = true;\n        return this\n    }\n\n    build(): Sandwhich { \n        console.log(this)\n        return new Sandwhich(this)\n    }\n    \n}\n\nconst sandwhich = (new SandwhichBuilder(BreadTypes.wheat))\n    .addCheese()\n    .addTomato()\n    .build()\n \n```\n\nFull Example:\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/e48pLck3/15/embed/js,result/\"></script>\n\nOf course this can also be done with a simple object as a param like so:\n\n```ts\nenum BreadTypes { \n    wheat,\n    rye,\n    white,\n    oat\n}\n\ninterface SandwhichBuilder { \n    breadType: BreadTypes,\n    cheese: boolean,\n    tomato: boolean\n}\nclass Sandwhich{\n\tconstructor(builder : SandwhichBuilder) {\n    \t\t// ... \n\t}\n}\n\nconst builder: SandwhichBuilder = { breadType: BreadTypes.rye, cheese: true, tomato: false}\n\nconst sandwhich = new Sandwhich(builder)\n\n```\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/pg0yqa1c/1/embed/js,result/\"></script>\n\nThat was the builder pattern... now what to build?","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/builder-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890077897},"$loki":5},{"slug":"chain-of-responsibility","title":"The Chain of Responsibility","published":true,"date":"2019-04-14T12:19","desc":"In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects.

A request enters from one end and keeps moving along the chain until it finds a suitable handler. \n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.\n\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> Say for example you had three methods of payment. You wanted a payment to be handled by the balance which had enough to cover the charge, if method `A` did not have the funds method `B` would try to handle the payment and so on until the payment is complete or cannot be hanldedby any of the accounts.\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nHere's what all accounts must be able to do:\n\n```ts\nabstract class Account {\n\n    protected successor: Account;\n    protected balance: number;\n\n    public setNext(account: Account): void {\n        this.successor = account;\n    }\n\n    public pay(amountToPay: number): void {\n        if (this.canPay(amountToPay)) {\n            console.log(`Paid ${amountToPay} using ${this.constructor.name}`)\n        } else if (this.successor) {\n            console.log(`Cannot pay using ${this.constructor.name}, Proceeding...`)\n            this.successor.pay(amountToPay);\n        } else {\n            throw new Error('Not enough balance');\n        }\n    }\n\n    public canPay(amount: number): boolean {\n        return this.balance >= amount;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow let's setup the payment mentods:\n\n```ts\n\nclass Bank extends Account {\n    constructor(protected balance) {\n        super()\n    }\n}\n\nclass Paypal extends Account {\n    constructor(protected balance) {\n        super()\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bitcoin extends Account {\n    constructor(protected balance) {\n        super()\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nTie them together and handle a payment:\n\n```ts\nconst bank = new Bank(100);\nconst paypal = new Paypal(200);\nconst bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300)\n\nbank.setNext(paypal);\npaypal.setNext(bitcoin);\n\nbank.pay(259);\n\n// Cannot pay using Bank, Proceeding...\n// Cannot pay using Paypal, Proceeding...\n// Paid 259 using Bitcoin\n```","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/chain-of-responsibility","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890077926},"$loki":6},{"slug":"command-pattern","title":"The Command Pattern","published":true,"date":"2019-04-30T15:00","desc":"In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.

The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.\n\n\nReal World Example:\n\n`client` -> `invoker` -> `command` -> `reciever`\n\n> You (the `client`) are switching (the `command`) on a light (the `reciever`)\nvia a remote control (the `invoker`).\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nThe `receiver` has the implementation of every action that could be performed:\n\n```ts\n// Receiver\nclass Bulb { \n    public turnOn() { \n        console.log('bulb on!')\n    }\n\n    public turnOff() { \n        console.log('bulb off!')\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThere is also an iterface for each command and an implementation of that command:\n\n```ts\ninterface ICommand { \n    execute(): void;\n    undo(): void;\n    redo(): void;\n}\n\n// Command\nclass TurnOn implements ICommand { \n    constructor(protected bulb: Bulb) { }\n    public execute() {\n        this.bulb.turnOn();\n     }\n    public undo() {\n        this.bulb.turnOff();\n     }\n    public redo() { \n        this.execute();\n    }\n}\n\nclass TurnOff implements ICommand { \n    constructor(protected bulb: Bulb) { }\n    public execute() {\n        this.bulb.turnOff();\n     }\n    public undo() {\n        this.bulb.turnOn();\n     }\n    public redo() { \n        this.execute();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen an `invoker` with whom the client will interact with to process the command:\n\n```ts\nclass RemoteControl { \n    submit(command: ICommand) { \n        command.execute();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd now we can tie it all together:\n\n```ts\n// receiver\nvar bulb = new Bulb();\n\n// commands\nvar turnOn = new TurnOn(bulb);\nvar turnOff = new TurnOff(bulb);\n\n// invoker\nvar remote = new RemoteControl();\n\n// client\nremote.submit(turnOn);\nremote.submit(turnOff);\n```\n","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/command-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890077949},"$loki":7},{"slug":"composite-pattern","title":"The Composite Pattern","date":"2019-02-19T21:03","desc":"In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern.

Name: Composite\n\n## Type: Structural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nSelectively treat a group of objects that are part of a hierarchy as \"the same\" when they are in fact different. \n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to \"compose\" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> Every organisation is composed of employees. Each of the employees has the same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> The composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nSay we had the following types of employees:\n\n```ts\ninterface IEmployee{\n    getName(): string;\n    setSalary(salary: number);\n    getSalary(): number;\n    getRoles(): string[];\n}\n\nclass Developer implements IEmployee{\n    protected roles;\n    \n    constructor(protected name: string, protected salary:number){\n    }\n\n    public getName(): string{\n        return this.name;\n    }\n\n    setSalary(salary: number){\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n\n    getSalary(): number{\n        return this.salary;\n    }\n\n    public getRoles(): string[]{\n        return this.roles;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Designer implements IEmployee{\n    protected roles;\n    \n    constructor(protected name: string, protected salary:number){\n    }\n\n    public getName(): string{\n        return this.name;\n    }\n\n    setSalary(salary: number){\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n\n    getSalary(): number{\n        return this.salary;\n    }\n\n    public getRoles(): string[]{\n        return this.roles;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the following organisation:\n\n```ts\nclass Organisation{\n    protected employees : IEmployee[] = [];\n\n    public addEmployee(employee: IEmployee){\n        this.employees = this.employees.concat(employee);\n    }\n\n    public getNetSalaries(): number{\n        let netSalary = 0;\n\n        for(let employee of this.employees) {\n            netSalary += employee.getSalary();\n        }\n\n        return netSalary;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe could use it as follows:\n\n```ts\n// Prepare the employees\nconst john = new Developer('John Doe', 12000);\nconst jane = new Designer('Jane Doe', 15000);\n\n// Add them to organization\nconst organisation = new Organisation();\norganisation.addEmployee(john);\norganisation.addEmployee(jane);\nconsole.log(`Net salaries: ${organisation.getNetSalaries()}`) // Net Salaries: 27000\n```\n\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/1v2t7kw6/5/embed/js,result/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/composite-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.138Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890077985},"$loki":8},{"slug":"css-sanity-with-sass","title":"CSS sanity with SASS: Setup.","date":"2017-09-09T18:27","desc":"CSS can be painful to write and even worse to maintain...","metadata":{"Sass":"Blog"},"taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["web development","web design","CSS"]},"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"article":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"NewsArticle","image":{"@type":"ImageObject"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject"}}},"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$","@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Restaurant","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"}},"facebookenable":true,"person":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"person","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"}},"event":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Event","location":{"@type":"Place"}},"musicalbum":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"MusicAlbum","byArtist":{"@type":"MusicGroup"}},"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"CSS can be painful to write and even worse to maintain..."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\"as I tack on line 1000 of a css file in fear of breaking something otherwise\""}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I think even those that truely love language would agree.

If you lean towards the front end of web development CSS is unavoidable. CSS shouldn't be this painful, we as programmers/developers/hackers/code monkies should not shy away from making things look nice.\n\nAfter all who do you write programs for....other people, normally not programmers.As far as anyone else is concerned the UI is the program. They don't care how nicely you've abstracted functionality, how that new method you tried out worked or if you have clear comments. They want to interact with the program.\n\n> There is a better way\n\nintroducing _[`SASS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets`](http://sass-lang.com/guide)_:\n\nThis language makes sense, it organizes things effectively and clearly. Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.\n\nIt's been around a while in web dev terms (since 2006),  but has really gained popularity over the last few years and is currently used and supported in many web development technologies such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is supported in the 2017 Adobe Dreamweaver (yes it still exsists).\n\nSo let's get started, I'll be using Linux this will probably work on Mac but will obviously not on Windows.\n\nWe have to have some way to compile the SassScript, for that we need `Ruby` a programming language that gained popularity with `Rails` a server side framework written in `Ruby`.\n\nI use a [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) which stands for Ruby version manager... I'm sure you can guess what it does. This will keep things neat and tidy.\n\nFollow the download instructions for `RVM`. After that run:\n\n`rvm install <the_ruby_version_you_want>`\n\neg:\n\n`rvm  install 2.3.1`\n`rvm use 2.3.1`\n\nthen:\n\n`rvm rubygems latest`\n\nnow we install [compass](http://compass-style.org/) an open-source CSS Authoring Framework. This will allow us to turn our Sass files into CSS,  you may or may not need sudo here..\n\n[![Screenshot_from_2017-09-08_21-57-49.png](https://s26.postimg.org/uopgm49y1/Screenshot_from_2017-09-08_21-57-49.png)](https://postimg.org/image/8009mjsk5/)\n\nWe are ready to roll:\n\nset up a `config.rb` file in your project root to let compass know what's up, here's a sample to get you started:\n\n```bash\n# Require any additional compass plugins here.\n# defaults to project root\n\nhttp_path = \"/\"\ncss_dir = \"css\"\nsass_dir=\"sass\"\nimages_dir = \"images\"\njavascripts_dir = \"js\"\nfonts_dir = \"fonts\"\n\noutput_style = :nested\n\n# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:\n# relative_assets = true\n\nline_comments = false\n\n\n# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this\n# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:\n# preferred_syntax = :sass\n# and then run:\n# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass\n```\n\nFor more details on configuration check out the compass [docs](http://compass-style.org/help/documentation/configuration-reference/)\n<br/>\nbe sure to set your paths correctly this example project looks like this:\n\n```bash\nindex.html\n|\ncss/styles.css\n|\n|--sass/ \n|    |-- partials/                   # Partials do a quick google search for \"Sass partials\"\n|    |    |-- _base.sass        # imports for all mixins + global project variables\n|    |-- styles.scss     \n|\n|--js/\n|--images/\n|--fonts/\n|\n```\n<br/>\nnext run either `compass watch` to watch for changes to Sass files and auto compile to CSS or manually  run `compass compile` to turn your Sass into CSS.\n\nWell I didn't really cover Sass here but at least your ready to go! \n\nHead over to [http://thesassway.com/](http://thesassway.com/) for some great tutorials. Check out the `Advanced` section to get your mind blown.\n\nYou can always try Sass at somewhere like  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/#) without all the overhead. Simply choose Sass in the CSS preprocessors tab under settings.\n\nIt really is worth a little set up for a massive longterm gain. I've had great fun learning Sass and hope to dive a little deeper this year.\n\nSo I'll prob be posting about how to use Sass at some point in the future.\n\nUntil then...\n\nHappy

Name: Decorator\n\n## Type: Structural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nChange the behaviour of one object dynamically and transparently, without changing the class of objects.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> Say you ran a coffee shop offering multiple ways to serve coffee. How do you know how much to charge? You would add how much each variation costs and add that to the total cost of the coffee. See example below.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> Change the behaviour of one object dynamically and transparently, without changing the class of objects.\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nStart off with a basic coffee definition:\n\n```ts\ninterface Coffee{\n    getCost() : number;\n    getDescription() : string;\n}\n\nclass SimpleCoffee implements Coffee{\n    public getCost(){\n        return 10;\n    }\n\n    public getDescription(){\n        return 'Simple coffee';\n    }\n}\n\n```\nWe want to make the code extensible to allow options to modify it if required. Lets make some add-ons (decorators)\n\n```ts\nclass AsLatte implements Coffee{\n\n    constructor(protected coffee: Coffee){\n        this.coffee = coffee;\n    }\n\n    public getCost(){\n        return this.coffee.getCost() + 3;\n    }\n\n  public getDescription() {\n    return `${this.coffee.getDescription()\n    }, foam`\n    }\n}\n\n\nclass WithVanilla implements Coffee\n{\n      constructor(protected coffee: Coffee){\n        this.coffee = coffee;\n    }\n\n    public getCost(){\n        return this.coffee.getCost() + 5;\n    }\n\n  public getDescription() {\n    return `${this.coffee.getDescription()\n    }, vanilla`\n    }\n}\n\n```\nUsage:\n\n```ts\nlet someCoffee = new SimpleCoffee();\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getCost()); // 10\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getDescription()); // Simple Coffee\n\nsomeCoffee = new WithMilk(someCoffee);\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getCost()); // 12\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getDescription()); // Simple Coffee milk\n\n\nsomeCoffee = new AsLatte(someCoffee);\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getCost()); // 15\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getDescription()); // Simple Coffee milk, foam\n\nsomeCoffee = new WithVanilla(someCoffee);\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getCost()); // 20\nconsole.log(someCoffee.getDescription()); // Simple Coffee milk, foam, vanilla\n```\n\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/t84vLspz/7/embed/js/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/decorator-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078064},"$loki":11},{"slug":"facade-pattern","title":"The Facade Pattern","desc":"A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.","date":"2019-03-07T17:09","publish_date":"07-03-2019 17:09","taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["design patterns","structural"]},"twitterenable":true,"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"musicalbumenabled":false,"productenabled":false,"product":{"ratingValue":2.5},"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"facebookenable":true,"toc":[{"id":"name-facade","depth":2,"text":"Name: Facade"},{"id":"type-structural","depth":2,"text":"Type: Structural"},{"id":"use-when-you-want-to","depth":2,"text":"Use when you want to:"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"name-facade"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#name-facade","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Name: Facade"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"type-structural"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#type-structural","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Type: Structural"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"use-when-you-want-to"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#use-when-you-want-to","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Use when you want to:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"From Wikipedia:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Real World Example:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What do you do turn a computer on?

OS ready\n\n```\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/kpyL8jwc/3/embed/js/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/facade-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078079},"$loki":12},{"slug":"factory-pattern","title":"The Factory Pattern","date":"2018-12-28T12:14","desc":"In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be \"new\".","publish_date":"28-12-2018 12:14","taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["design patterns","creational"]},"twitterenable":true,"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"musicalbumenabled":false,"productenabled":false,"product":{"ratingValue":2.5},"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"facebookenable":true,"toc":[{"id":"name-factory","depth":3,"text":"Name: Factory"},{"id":"type-creational","depth":3,"text":"Type: Creational"},{"id":"use-when-you-want-to","depth":3,"text":"Use when you want to:"},{"id":"variants","depth":3,"text":"Variants"},{"id":"simple","depth":3,"text":"Simple"},{"id":"method","depth":3,"text":"Method"},{"id":"abstract","depth":3,"text":"Abstract"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"name-factory"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#name-factory","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Name: Factory"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"type-creational"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#type-creational","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Type: Creational"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"use-when-you-want-to"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#use-when-you-want-to","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Use when you want to:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Generate an instance for a client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hide the dependencies of class instantiation from clients"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"variants"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#variants","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Variants"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"simple"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#simple","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Simple"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"From Wikipedia:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be \"new\"."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Real World Example:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You are building a house that needs doors.

instantiation logic to the client\n* Hide the dependencies of class instantiation from clients\n\n### Variants\n\n### Simple\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is assumed to be \"new\".\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> You are building a house that needs doors. You can either build the door from scratch, with all the things needed to do so (glue, tools, knowledge) or you can call the factory and have them build a door for you.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client\n \nTypescript Code Example:\n\nDoor interface and implementation\n\n```ts\ninterface IDoor{\n\tgetWidth: () => number;\n\tgetHeight: () => number;\n}\n\nclass WoodenDoor implements IDoor {\n  constructor(public width: number, public height: number){\n  }\n\n  getWidth(): number{\n    return this.width\n  }\n\n  getHeight(): number{\n    return this.height\n  }\n}\n\n```\nDoor Factory that makes an instance of the Door\n\n```ts\nclass DoorFactory{\n\tpublic static makeDoor(w : number, h: number){ \n        return new WoodenDoor(w, h)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd can be used like so:\n\n```ts\nconst door = DoorFactory.makeDoor(100, 200)\n\nconsole.log(door.getWidth())\nconsole.log(door.getHeight())\n\nconst anotherDoor = DoorFactory.makeDoor(50,100)\n```\nFull example:\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/bkmf1Lct/2/embed/js,result/\"></script>\n\n### Method\n\nThis is a variation on the simple factory we looked at above. This method is used when there is some generic processing on a class but want to vary what kind of things the processing is done on.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.\n\nAnalogy:\n\n> Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.\n\nMain purpose:\n\n> It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.\n\nTypescript Code example:\n\nSetup variations of question askers\n```ts\ninterface IInterviewer{\n    askQuestions: () => void;\n}\n\nclass Developer implements IInterviewer {\n  askQuestions() {\n    console.log('Asking about design patterns!')\n  }\n}\n\nclass CommunityExecutive implements IInterviewer {\n  askQuestions() {\n    console.log('Asking about community building')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAsking the question\n```ts\nabstract class HiringManager{\n\n    // Factory method\n    protected abstract makeInterviewer() : IInterviewer;\n\n    public takeInterview(){\n        const interviewer = this.makeInterviewer();\n        interviewer.askQuestions();\n    }\n}\n```\nWho asks the question\n```ts\nclass DevelopmentManager extends HiringManager {\n    makeInterviewer() {\n        return new Developer()\n    }\n}\n\nclass MarketingManager extends HiringManager {\n    makeInterviewer() {\n        return new CommunityExecutive()\n    }\n}\n```\nUsage\n```ts\nconst devManager = new DevelopmentManager()\ndevManager.takeInterview() // Output: Asking about design patterns\n\nconst marketingManager = new MarketingManager()\nmarketingManager.takeInterview()// Output: Asking about community building \n```\n\nFull Example:\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/nubskw0c/8/embed/js,result/\"></script>\n\n### Abstract\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes\n\nAnalogy:\n\n> Back to doors. Say this time we need a wooden door from a wood shop and a iron door from a iron shop. For each type of door you would need a different worker to create and fit the door.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> A way to group individual but related/dependant factories together without specifying their concrete class\n\nDoor interface implementation\n```ts\ninterface Door {\n    getDescription() : void;\n}\n\nclass WoodenDoor implements Door{\n    public getDescription(){\n        console.log('I am a wooden door');\n    }\n}\n\nclass IronDoor implements Door{\n    public getDescription(){\n        console.log('I am an iron door')\n    }\n}\n```\nDoor Fitter and implemenation\n```ts\ninterface DoorFittingExpert {\n    getDescription() : void;\n}\n\nclass Welder implements DoorFittingExpert{\n    public getDescription(){\n        console.log('I can only fit iron doors');\n    }\n}\n\nclass Carpenter implements DoorFittingExpert{\n    public getDescription(){\n        console.log('I can only fit wooden doors');\n    }\n}\n```\nGrouping the dependencies together\n```ts\ninterface DoorFactory {\n    makeDoor(): Door;\n    makeFittingExpert(): DoorFittingExpert;\n}\n\n// Wooden factory to return carpenter and wooden door\nclass WoodenDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {\n    public makeDoor(): Door {\n        return new WoodenDoor();\n    }\n\n    public makeFittingExpert(): DoorFittingExpert{\n        return new Carpenter();\n    }\n}\n\n// Iron door factory to get iron door and the relevant fitting expert\nclass IronDoorFactory implements DoorFactory{\n    public makeDoor(): Door {\n        return new IronDoor();\n    }\n\n    public makeFittingExpert(): DoorFittingExpert{\n        return new Welder();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUsage\n\n```ts\n\nconst woodenFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory()\n\nconst woodenDoor = woodenFactory.makeDoor()\nconst woodExpert = woodenFactory.makeFittingExpert()\n\nwoodenDoor.getDescription()  // Output: I am a wooden door\nwoodExpert.getDescription() // Output: I can only fit wooden doors\n\n// Same for Iron Factory\nconst ironFactory = new IronDoorFactory()\n\nconst ironDoor = ironFactory.makeDoor()\nconst ironExpert = ironFactory.makeFittingExpert()\n\nironDoor.getDescription()  // Output: I am an iron door\nironExpert.getDescription() // Output: I can only fit iron doors\n```\nFull Example:\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/o683w0fg/4/embed/js,result/\"></script>\n\nAnd that in a nutshell is the factory pattern!","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/factory-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078132},"$loki":13},{"slug":"flyweight-pattern","title":"The Flyweight Pattern","date":"2019-03-12T12:16","desc":"In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern.

Name: Flyweight\n\n## Type: Structural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nAvoid recomputing data that has previously been computed. (memoization).\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern. A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> Say you went to a tea stall at a busy market and ordered some tea. They might make more than one cup to use for the person behid you in the line and therefore save the resources used to boil the water.\n\nMain Purpose:\n\n> It is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nSetup teapot:\n\n```ts\n// Anything that will be cached is flyweight.\n// Types of tea here will be flyweights.\nclass Teapot{\n    constructor(public teaType: string) { \n        console.log(`Teapot filled`)\n    }\n\n    public getTeaType() { \n        return this.teaType\n    }\n}\n```\nOur tea maker and shop:\n\n```ts\n// Acts as a factory and saves the tea\nclass TeaMaker{\n    protected availableTea = new Map([]);\n\n    public make(preference: string) {\n        if (!this.availableTea.has(preference)) {\n            this.availableTea.set(preference, new Teapot(preference))\n        }\n\n        return this.availableTea.get(preference)\n    }\n}\n\nclass TeaShop{\n    protected orders = [];\n    public constructor(protected teaMaker: TeaMaker) { \n    }\n\n    public takeOrder(teaType: string, table: number) {\n        this.orders[table] = this.teaMaker.make(teaType)\n    }\n\n    public serve(){\n        for( const order in this.orders) {\n            console.log(`Serving ${this.orders[order].getTeaType()} to table #${order}`)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nUsage:\n```ts\nconst teaMaker = new TeaMaker();\nconst shop = new TeaShop(teaMaker);\n\nshop.takeOrder('lemon', 1);\nshop.takeOrder('milky', 2);\nshop.takeOrder('mint', 5);\nshop.takeOrder('lemon', 3);\n\nshop.serve();\n\n// Teapot filled\n// Teapot filled\n// Teapot filled\n// Serving lemon to table #1\n// Serving milky to table #2\n// Serving mint to table #5\n// Serving lemon to table #3\n\n// note that the Teapot is filled three times but the served four\n```\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/w2zqxhba/1/embed/js/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/flyweight-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078158},"$loki":14},{"slug":"force","title":"Force","desc":"A vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate.

A young Vietnamese programmer named Dong Nguyen released a game that he would later remove from the App store from guilt of overuse and the addictive nature of the game. That game was Flappy Bird.\n\n![flappy-bird.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeb1KvmvKkkGMwC4R7LgCvPNr9ajFWSjaHJCHyZxniYbn/flappy-bird.jpg)\n \nToday I am going to inform you on how to make it. Now this is just one way of doing it, there is no way I can go into any level of detail to have you publishing on the app store in a short write up like this one.  Think of the following steps like a template for anyone who would like to get started and learn more about theories behind programming and animation. I have been writing code professionally for close to year so my relative knowledge is fairly limited but hopefully I can convey the main aspects of this program.\n\nI will briefly talk about the tools involved and then go on to talk about the concept used to generate a basic physics and game engine using a coding style known as Object Oriented Programming.\n\n### Tooling up\n\nThe Language I will be using is known as JavaScript which is a dynamic , high-level, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm interpreted programming language that runs in the browser, currently the only language to run natively in the browser.

This is the lower barrier to entry and getting started that there is in programming.\n\n### The Process\n\nInitially we must write the code to create a canvas or run our program ( or to use a P5 term the sketch ). The library introduces us to the idea of a setup and a draw concept. The setup allows us to create the things that we are going to use within the draw loop that continues to run throughout the lifespan of the sketch.\n\nLuckily that is very easy in P5.js which uses a very simple syntax to allow rich functionality. Programming languages in general aim to express the sequence of actions required to create functionality. This is as more for the human side of the equation as it is for the machine underneath. \n\nJS’s syntax allows for the concept of Object Orientated Programming, which is for another talk. Simply we are going to create the things needed for the game in code. We need a bird and pipes. That’s it. We then need to give behavior to the bird and the pipes.\n\nLet’s line up the steps in creating the Flappy Bird Game:\n* Create a canvas add a bird and many pipes.  \n* To the bird add x and y position, a way for it to appear and update in the draw loop. Add forces, gravity, lift, drag.\n*  Make the pipes appear at random points on the canvas.\n*  Add the functionality to react to the space bar being pressed.\n\nHere is the game action:\n\n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"KQwOKL\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Crappy Bird\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/KQwOKL/\">Crappy Bird</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nThe Flappy Bird game uses a series of objects with behaviour that reacts to user input.

Name: Iterator\n\n## Type: Behavioural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nAccess the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.\n\nReal world example:\n\n> An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nCreate a radio station:\n\n```ts\nclass RadioStation {\n\n    constructor(private frequency: number) {\n        this.frequency = frequency    \n    }\n    \n    getFrequency() {\n        return this.frequency\n    }\n} \n```\n\nAnd a list of stations\n\n```ts\nclass StationList {\n    \n    constructor(public stations: RadioStation[] = []){\n    }\n\n    addStation(station) {\n        this.stations.push(station)\n    }\n    \n    removeStation(toRemove) {\n        const toRemoveFrequency = toRemove.getFrequency()\n        this.stations = this.stations.filter(station => {\n            return station.getFrequency() !== toRemoveFrequency\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIterate through th list:\n\n````ts\nconst stationList = new StationList()\n\nstationList.addStation(new RadioStation(89))\nstationList.addStation(new RadioStation(101))\nstationList.addStation(new RadioStation(102))\nstationList.addStation(new RadioStation(103.2))\n\nstationList.stations.forEach(station => console.log(station.getFrequency()))\n\nstationList.removeStation(new RadioStation(89))\n```","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/iterator-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078215},"$loki":18},{"slug":"javascript-101-better-event-handling","title":"JavaScript 101  ~  Better Event Handling","desc":"In a previous post I took at look event handling in JavaScript.

This is important. \n \n### Moving on.. \n \nClosure is often leveraged in JavaScript to make modules, in order stop variables interacting with each other and causing unexpected side effects. Closures make code more compact, readable and beautiful and promote functional re-use. Understanding closure will greatly improve your ability to write clean and reusable code in JavaScript. \n \nSo lets begin to try and wrap our heads around the concept. The first step to understanding closure is to understand that a reference to function can be returned to a variable, what's that supposed to mean? ..let's look at a quick example. \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/drkbbaL3/embed/\"></script> \n \nIn this case that variable is <code>hi</code>, it can then be invoked and the returned function that it stores will run. \n \n### How does this differ from other languages? \n \nA programmer using Java would think of the function as returning a pointer to a function, and that the variables <code>speak</code> and <code>hi</code> were each a pointer to a function. \n \nThere is a key difference between a Java pointer to a function and a JavaScript reference to a function. In JavaScript, you can think of a function reference variable as having both a pointer to a function as well as a hidden pointer to a closure. \n \nThis means that the inner function has access to the outer functions variables, and therefore has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables ( although it is probably best to avoid global variables all together )..  \n \nThis may sound weird, but I think of the outer function as almost blossoming the inner function which is still attached to outer leaves as it blossoms like this... \n<br/><br/> \n![](./images/bud_.jpg?cropResize=350,350){.blog_img} \n \nIn fairness I did give you a weirdness warning.Regardless, In most other common languages, after a function returns, all the local variables are no longer accessible because the stack-frame is destroyed. \n \nThe above code has a closure because the anonymous function <code>function() { log(`Hi ${name}`); }</code> is declared inside another function, <code>hello()</code>. In JavaScript, if you use the function keyword inside another function, you are creating a closure. \n \nThis is an extremely powerful idea, and allows us to expose aspects of our code whilst simulating privacy, let's look at a more interesting example. \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/kkg8rfo2/3/embed/\"></script> \n \nAs always the code is commented to hopefully highlight what is going on, this is a simple example of how to expose a public api ( the things a user or program can interact with ), using a module pattern ( and closure ) in JavaScript. \n \nSome additional resources:  \n* [Closures with ease](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/) \n* [Organizing JavaScript Functionality a course on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) \n \n","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/javascript-101-closure","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078233},"$loki":20},{"slug":"javascript-101-funky-functions-part-1","title":"JavaScript 101 ~ Funky functions part 1","desc":"JavaScript has its quirks and that's one of the many things I like about it, but it does have some potential gotchas that are worth noting.

I had full intention to talk about the other implicit argument ___this___ in part 2 but I found myself going down a different path. \n \nThere are so many ways to invoke functions in JavaScript I thought I better take a closer look at that first. JavaScript implements the idea of first-class functions i.e. they are given the same privileges as objects, in fact they are objects. They can be passed into other functions as arguments, they can be stored in variables or as methods on objects and even returned from other functions. \n \nThis is extremely cool and confusing at the same time, for me anyway. I intend to rectify the second part of that statement. So, let's look at some ways we can define and invoke functions. \n \nI'm looking at six different ways to add two numbers together in this example. As you lookthem, make a mental note of the differences,they are subtle.  \n \nNote: There is also a way to create a function using 'new' ( e.g. fun = new function; ) however I believe it has depreciated/is more of a corner feature of JavaScript, you might see it only occasionally.For that reason I choose not to look at it in anymore detail( although one day I may have to ) .  \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/uow32pb5/6/embed/\"></script>\n \nAs you can see there is plenty of syntax to choose from, they all have their own use cases, which cannot really be shown in a simple add function. \n \n### Let's look at a few of the more common ones in a little more detail \n \n#### function declaration \n \nFirstly we use the 'function' keyword, followed by a compulsory function name, a list of parameters in a pair of parenthesis (param1, param2,...etc) and a pair of curly braces {...} that defines the body code ( the do stuff part ). \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/11k81t1p/3/embed/\"></script> \n \nThe function declaration creates a variable in the current [scope](https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/) identified as the function name. The variable contains the function object. \n \nThe function variable is moved (or hoisted) to the top of the current scope, this allows functions to be called before they have been declared, more on this at another time. \n \nNote: The function object holds its name in the 'name' property of itself. This is something that can viewed and used in debugging. \n \n#### function expression \n \nA function expression starts with the function keyword, any parameters then an optional name, followed by the body of the code. \n<code> function( param1, param2 ...etc){..//do stuff...}; </code>. \n \nThis function expression can be: \n \n* Assigned to a variable <code> var expression = function( param1, param2 ...etc){..//do stuff...}; </code>. \n* Assigned as method on a object <code> method : function( param1, param2 ...etc){..//do stuff...}; </code>. \n* Used as a callback <code> .reduce(function( param1, param2 ...etc){..//do stuff...}); </code>. \n \n#### arrow function \n \nThe arrow function uses parenthesis for the parameters <code>( param1, ..etc)</code>, followed by a fat arrow => and a pair of curly braces again for the body. \n \nAn example:  \n<code>var multiply = (x, y) => x*y;</code> \n \nAnother One:  \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/y7fhqc9k/embed/\"></script> \n \n#### A little something extra \n \nHere's something I made for my own amusement: \n \n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"dark\" data-slug-hash=\"MoadRQ\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Different types of functions in JavaScript\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/MoadRQ/\">Different types of functions in JavaScript</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p> \n<script async src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script> \n \nSome additional resources: \n \n* [A great article by Dmitri Pavlutin](https://rainsoft.io/6-ways-to-declare-javascript-functions/#1functiondeclaration) \n* [A deep dive into scope by Todd Motto](https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/)","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/javascript-101-funky-functions-part-2","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078256},"$loki":22},{"slug":"javascript-101-this","title":"JavaScript 101  ~  This","desc":"If you have spent some time reading or writing JavaScript, you will have no doubt came across the `this` keyword.

In other object orientated languages, the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. In JavaScript the value of this depends on the context of the function and where it is called.Not knowing this or rather `this` can be confusing. \n \nIn a [previous post](http://adamharpur.com/blog/javascript-101-funky-functions-part-1) I looked at the silently passed argument `argument`, where I mentioned that there where two, `this` is the second and more widely used of these implicit arguments. \n \nIn this post I'm going to be looking at `this` in four different situations: \n* In a regular function. \n* When a function is called as a method. \n* In a function that's being called as a constructor. \n* When you explicitly set the value of `this` manually using `bind`, `apply`, or `call`. \n \nLet's get started... \n \n#### In a regular function \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/d9zpz8dx/embed/\"></script> \n \nIn a regular function ( or anywhere outside of a function ) when in **non strict mode** `this` refers to the window object, or the root of the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model). In **strict mode** i.e.. when `\"use strict\"` is at the top of the JavaScript file, `this` is undefined, which is probably more desirable and will reduce any unwanted side effects. \n \n#### When a function is called as a method \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/o5y9oLyu/7/embed/\"></script>\n \n`this` inside of an object refers to the object on which the method is being called on. In the above example this refers to the anObject..object. Gordon Zhu founder of [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript), uses the term \"the left of the dot rule\", which I think is a great way to identifying what `this` will refer to. \n \nFor example if we had something that looked like `object.innerObject.oneMoreObj.doSomething()` using the \"left of the dot rule\", We can quickly see that doSomething is a method of the oneMoreObj object. \n \n#### In a function that's being called as a constructor \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/tzt2ys7x/8/embed/\"></script>\n \nIn a function that's being used as a constructor, `this` points object that has been created from the constructor. \n \n#### When you explicitly set the value of `this` manually using `bind`, `apply`, or `call`. \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/m7k88ujv/embed/\"></script> \n \nBind sets the 'this' of the function, call and apply execute the function and set the `this`. Call and apply are very similar except apply takes arguments as an array and call takes its arguments as a comma separated list. I look at the first letter to remember the difference, apply: array, call: commas.

Functional programming is extremely powerful, but there is a lot of jargon and new concepts to come to terms with, function composition is one of these terms that I'll be looking at in this post. \n \n### What is function composition? \n \nFunction composition is the combing of two or more functions to make another entirely new function.Functions are treated like parts that can be combined to make new parts that process data in new ways. The concept is really powerful and useful. \n \nLet's look at a quick example:  \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/pcv6fupy/3/embed/\"></script> \n \nIn the above function we first define two binary functions ( a function that takes two inputs ). Then we define a function ```compose``` that takes two functions as arguments ```f``` and ```g```, when then return a function that takes three arguments that are then passed to the binary functions that are accessible via [closure](http://adamharpur.com/blog/javascript-101-closure). \n \nUsing functions in this way means that we can snap together the parts we need and make functions that do the work for us, many times the same basic functions can be reused over and over again saving rewriting a new function from scratch. \n \nHave a look at these example and you will start to get a feel for how functions can be used together to make new ones: \n \nIn this example we take a param double it and then square the result by its new value. So in this case 5 gets added to itself to make 10, which is then squared by itself to make 100. Study the code and try to really see what is happening, there are comments to make things a little clearer. \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/wk2zLkvr/6/embed/\"></script> \n \n \nHere we are defining a function to keep an index within a range, you can see that we use two functions called ```from``` and ```to``` to eventually create the final ```fromTo``` functions which keep the track of the numbers. A pillar of functional programming is to let the functions do the work, if you have something that is already written and can be utilized in making another function you need, then use it. \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/jk5rmjfa/2/embed/\"></script> \n \nThis one may be a little harder to follow, I was mainly just playing around with different concepts including currying which is something I will examine further in a future post. \n \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/6vtdndwj/4/embed/\"></script> \n \nSome additional resources:  \n \n* [Why use functional programming? by Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-learn-functional-programming-in-javascript-composing-software-ea13afc7a257) \n* [Master the JavaScript Interview: What is Function Composition? by Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0)\n* [Functional Programming for JavaScript People by Chet Corcos](https://medium.com/@chetcorcos/functional-programming-for-javascript-people-1915d8775504)","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/javascript-beyond-the-basics-function-composition","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078278},"$loki":24},{"slug":"javascript-es6-the-way-of-the-arrow-function","title":"JavaScript ES6 ~ The Way of the Arrow Function","desc":"Doing what is comfortable at the moment is not the best approach to learning how to code, for me anyway.

Some would argue that the ES6 syntax is more readable, but that's assuming that the reader understands the ES6 syntax. So let's make sure that's the case. The easiest comparison is the ES5 function expression. Which looks like this: \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/skwLm15g/embed/\"></script> \n \nvs the arrow syntax of the same function which looks like this: \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/e7twuh1r/embed/\"></script> \n \nBoth are stored in a variable ( I am using ```const``` to store arrow which is a ES6 syntax, but more on that another time ), both accept two parameters ```function( a, b )``` , ```( a, b )``` and return the result of those two parameters when they are added together ```{ return a + b }```, ``` => a + b ```. They are then passed two arguments ```expression( 1, 2 )```, ```arrow( 1, 2 )``` the result of which is stored in another variable ( again I am using the ES6 syntax in 'arrow' with ```let``` ) which is then output by the log function ( which is just a utility to output to the result pane in [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) ). \n \nSome [function composition](http://adamharpur.com/blog/javascript-beyond-the-basics-function-composition) using the arrow syntax: \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/5tx1o893/2/embed/\"></script> \n \n```comp``` takes a function ```f``` returns a function that takes another function ```g``` which returns a function that takes a parameter x. Which then calls ```g``` which is passed ```x``` the result of which is passed to ```f```. Here's the same functionality written in the ES5 syntax: \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/5tx1o893/4/embed/\"></script> \n \n### A practical example \n \nFirst in ES5: \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/p7jwd9nc/1/embed/\"></script> \n \nES6: \n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/raf24tjy/embed/\"></script> \n \nThe important difference between the two is that there is no need to define the context of ```this``` in the ES6 version. Using ''' var that = this'''  is clunky at best, of course you could use ```bind``` or pass ```this``` in as an extra parameter to ```.map``` but that is still not ideal. ES6 takes care of all the awkward sidestepping. \n \n### when not to use arrow functions \n \nArrow functions have use cases, and it is best if they are not used for the sake of using them. When using arrow functions '''this''' is ___not___ bound to anything, but simply inherits it from the scope of it's parent ( which is why it doesn't need defined in the \"prefixArray\" '''.map''' as its parent is the constructed instance of Prefixer ). However that sort of behavior can be the opposite of what we what in these cases: \n \n* click handlers ( we want '''this''' to bind to what was clicked not the global '''window''' object ) \n* object methods ( we want '''this''' to bind to the object not the global '''window''' object ) \n* prototype methods ( we want '''this''' to bind to the object not the global '''window''' object, note using arrow functions inside these methods is a great way to access the correct '''this''' context as shown in the example above). \n* when you want access to the '''arguments''' object more on the '''arguments object''' [here](http://adamharpur.com/blog/javascript-101-funky-functions-part-2)\n \nArrow functions are great when used correctly and they are a welcome edition to JavaScript native toolkit.

The art of programming is making decisions ahead of time and writing the code to deal with the potential decisions the program should know how to make depending  on the interactions of the user or other programs. \n \nSome examples: \n \nDecide if the user  is logged in \nDecide what data they would like \nDecide if a button is clicked \nDecide if another program needs data from a database \n \nThese are the micro decisions that allow the program to run. \n \nAs a builder understands the formation of the bricks and the grain of the wood, the engineer understands why the walls are there and the importance of the angle the frames join at. \n \nThis is the same for application development. I have to decided to look at the decision making process for making the bigger picture decisions that a software engineer or architect may have to make. \n \n## Define the Decision Clearly \n \nI have decided to make a data driven application that responds quickly to user interaction. \n \n## Consider All the Possible Choices \n \nThere are an infinite number of ways to make a program ,the five following patterns are some of the most common: \n \n### Layered (n-tier) architecture \n\nThis is a very common approach and found in a number of the larger frameworks for application development. The code is arranged so the data collected at the top tier and works it’s way down to the database. \n\ni.e. form data from website  → send to server → process the data → add to database. \n\nIt’s common for teams for developers to work on different tiers as each layer is independent from the layers below it. \n \n### Event-driven architecture \n\nAs the name suggests this pattern centers on responding to events, there is normally one main unit that receives data and then delegates it to a separate module that then handles the particular data type. This type of handoff is considered to be event generation and processing. \nThis type pattern is often used in interactive web documents that deal with events in the browser like mouse clicks or key strokes. \n\n### Micro kernel architecture \n\nThere are many applications that do the same operations over and over again in slightly different ways depending on the data and the task involved. The Micro kernel architecture is designed to deal with this  scenario.\n\nIt separates a minimal functional core from extended functionality and customer-specific parts. Meaning the program follows a basic set of rules which are then expanded upon for variations or additions of the core rules.\n \ni.e. The rules that govern a sales transaction, receive funds and exchange goods all follow the same basic pattern, but the type of payment and goods exchanged may differ. This would be implemented in the extension of the micro kernel.\n \n### Micro services architecture \n\nThe micro service architecture is designed to help developers avoid making programs too large and hard to maintain. \n\nInstead of building one big program, the goal is to create a number of different smaller programs and then create a new small program every time a new feature is requested.  \n\ni.e. Netflix uses this approach to separate all the components of the interface. Each section is its own separate entity that is bound together by the interface itself. \n\n### Space-based architecture \n\nMany applications are built around a database. When a database is under stress and can’t keep up with the constant challenge of writing a log of the transactions, the entire website may fail. \n\nThe space-based architecture is designed to avoid functional collapse under high load by splitting up both the processing and the storage between multiple servers. The data is spread out across the nodes \n\njust like the responsibility for servicing calls. \n\ni.e This is the architecture behind what many of us have come to know as cloud computing. \n \n## Gather All Relevant Information and Evaluate the Pros and Cons of Each \n\n### Possible Choices \n \n**Layered (n-tier) architecture** \n\nPros: \n\n* Easy to maintain if done correctly. \n* Testable. \n* Separation of concerns. \n\nCons: \n\n* Code has the potential to get messy if the process is organized. \n* Code can become slow if there are two many layers used. \n* Layer isolation can sometime be hard to follow. \n\n**Event-driven architecture** \n\nPros: \n\n* Very flexible. \n* Scales well. \n* Easy to extend. \n\nCons: \n\n* Hard to test. \n* If a module fails the main unit must have a back up. \n* Error handling can be difficult if many modules react to the same event. \n\n**Micro kernel architecture** \n\nPros: \n\n* Clearly divides basic routines and more complex rules. \n* Application can be used by many people in the same industry. \n\nCons: \n\n* Hard to decide what the core rules are. \n* Modifying the micro kernel can be difficult. \n* Plug-ins require a lot of communication with the kernel. \n \n**Micro services architecture** \n\nPros: \n\n* Tasks are easily separated. \n* Processes can be assigned by each module. \n* Development can be quick. \n* Good for remote development. \n\nCons: \n\n* Services have to be independent. \n* Performance can suffer if modules are too far spread out. \n* Can be confusing to end users as modules may load at different times. \n\n\n**Space-based architecture** \n\nPros: \n \n* Can Handle large amounts of data. \n* Good for large workloads. \n* Good for social networks. \n \nCons: \n \n* Hard to test load capabilities. \n* Data can sometimes be lost. \n \n## Select the Choice that Seems to Best Meet the Needs of the Situation \n \nDecision:  Event-driven architecture \n \nI have chosen this pattern as it will allow the application to respond quickly to events and allow for easier maintainability for a relatively small application. \n \nThere may be some difficulty handling errors as well as handling many events at once. There may be a case for using a Layered style such as MC which is a common implementation of the design pattern which would provide more reliability as well as providing a structure for the sub-modules that handle the events. \n \n## Implement a Plan of Action and Then Monitor the Results, Making Necessary Adjustments \n \nThrough the course of implementing the plan there were many times that the plan had to adapt to the growing requires of the program. Often during the actual development many small adjustments had to be made to ensure the project was a success. \n \n## The Plan, Do, Check, Act lifecycle \n \nThis is way to perform iterative planning allowing the main overall plan to flex and recalibrate in order to achieve the end goal that the plan was originally devised to achieve. \n \nHere is an example iteration: \n \n### Plan \n \nUsing a event driven architecture implement a question forum. \n \n### Do \n \nDevelop a page that presents user questions and answers together. \n \n### Check \n \nAsk the right questions. \n \nIs the best way to handle the data? \n \nA layered approach may be more applicable to handle the processing logic of the data. \n \n### Act \n \nBegin to develop with MVC pattern \n \nStart lifecycle again.\n\nThese iterations are important and your end result will most like end up a combination of architectural patterns. The important thing is knowing how and why you should be using them.\n\nHappy Coding!","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/make-a-decision","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078345},"$loki":27},{"slug":"make-some-perlin-noise","title":"Make some ( Perlin ) Noise","desc":"Perlin Noise allows us to make smooth randomness, It was originally developed to create textures in 3d graphics.

The program will figure out which walls of the cells to remove to create a maze.\n\n![](01-grid.png)\n\nSo, the cell object will need to know it's location on the grid, it's row number ( y ) and column number ( x ).\n\nIt will also need to know it's wall status ( whether it is opened or closed ).\n\nIn this next chunk of code I will create the grid and cell objects.\n\nI will need the following variables:\n\n* The grid width, height\n\n* The cell width, height \n\n* The row total ( grid height / cell height )\n\n* The column total ( grid width / cell width )\n\nOnce the values are calculated I will iterate through each row and for each row iterate through the columns and each cell will get its row number and column number.\n\nThen calling the show method ( this is where the render logic will be ) I can render the cell. It's worth mentioning I am using the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/) library to do most of the rendering. It makes drawing in the browser much easier and it's really fun to use.\n\nHere is our starting point:\n\n\n<p data-height=\"650\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"dqJZWz\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-pen-title=\"Grid\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/dqJZWz/\">Grid</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nThis is rough and will be cleaned up as the program evolves, I normally like to get something working before I refactor.\n\nThe cells are lines that run the perimeter of the cell using a line that connects these points.( Our x and y coordinates draw from the top left ).\n\n![](02-cell-corners.png)\n\n> Note the `this.walls` array on the cell, this will tell our cell whether it's wall is enabled or disabled in this order: top, right, bottom, left\n\nI spent some time refactoring the plot method to DRY up the function. This is the base for the next stage.\n\nNow we can break down our algorithm which follows these steps:\n\n* Make the initial cell and mark it as visited\n* While there are unvisited cells:\n    \n    if any neighbours of the current cell have not been visited.\n       \n        1.

So first the difference is computed and if the value is -1 the neighbour is to the right or bottom of the current cell and if the value is 1 the neighbour is to the left or top.\n\n![](04-walls.png)\n\n\nIn the above scenario the left wall of the neighbour is removed and the right wall of the current cell.\n\nThe corresponding walls are then switched off for the cell. This will give the maze it's shape.\n\nThere is still one problem, if we run into a dead end the cell stops moving and thr program stops. This is where the backtracker comes in.\n\nThis will allow the cell to know where it has been and to jump back to that position.\n\nA stack is used to keep track of these past positions. This is represented in code by an array that gets items ( in this case the current cell before switching to next ) pushed and popped on and off of it. This is know as a last in, first out structure.\n\nIn Javascript there is already the push and pop functionality on an array which makes it the perfect data structure to hold our data.\n\nThere isn't much code to add, and here is our finished maze generator:\n\n<p data-height=\"650\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"NLyBJJ\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-pen-title=\"Grid with generator and removing walls and backtracking\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/NLyBJJ/\">Grid with generator and removing walls and backtracking</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\n\nThat was a brief look at maze generator in Javascript.

This is second.\nconst saved = editor.save()\n\n// Type some more\neditor.type('And this is third.')\n\n// Output: Content before Saving\nconsole.log(editor.getContent())// This is the first sentence.

I learnt a little more about vectors and vector math this week so I'm sharing my notes.\n\n[Last post](https://steemit.com/javascript/@harps116/day-6-vectors) I looked at add a vectors together to vectors, let's remind ourselves how that works:\n\n![add_vectors.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZf3wEmjEX7DFHkENTgyE5EEYahJUsXS1Vre4vTbSiiKo/add_vectors.png)\n\nIn the above diagram we are adding A to B to get R. We are putting these vectors A and B end to end to get R. This new line R is the result of adding the two.\n\nThis maps to the idea of location and velocity, let's draw out our bouncing ball example:\n\n![adding_vectors.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmceb6jjnrFyrBbXNum3QjKNBFp7s2CNixJAcM6TG8AzuZ/adding_vectors.png)\n\nHere is the example in code:\n\n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"qpgPLg\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Simple Bouncing Ball Vector\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/qpgPLg/\">Simple Bouncing Ball Vector</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nWe add the location to velocity to get the new location. The formula in psuedo-code:\n\n```ts\nnewLocation.x = location.x + velocity.x\nnewLocation.y = location.y + velocity.y\n\n```\nNow that we have have a handle on adding let's look at subtraction. There isn't that much difference. All we are doing is replacing the add with subtract but it does require a little extra thinking. Lets first write the pseudo code and then draw it out.\n\n```ts\nW.x = V.x - U.x\nW.y = V.y - U.y\n\n```\nWe'll be able to give these letters more meaning after we draw it out:\n\n![sub_vectors.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVx8FdP3rb47Dvw7Wow6BbT6MMzvicfmZDj21aQ8iJiD4/sub_vectors.png)\n\nTo subtract the vectors we lay the vectors end to end but when subtracting we inverse the direction of one keeping the magnitude ( size ). The vector between the two is the result. In this case we have found the Velocity between the two points.\n\nnow in we can label those letters:\n\n```ts\nvelocity.x = mouseV.x - centerV.x\nvelocity.y = mouseV.y - centerV.y\n\n```\n\nHere's an example using code: \n\n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"WdVyMg\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Vector Subtraction P5\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/WdVyMg/\">Vector Subtraction P5</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nIt is best to follow the link to see the full functionality, hover your mouse around the screen and the line will follow. \n\nThat's all I managed this week.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nCheck out Daniel Shiffman's great series on the [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/), this 100 days of learning is a great excuse for me to finally work through the lessons and take some notes as I go.","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/more-vectors","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078392},"$loki":32},{"slug":"normal-distribution-taming-the-random","title":"Normal Distribution, Taming the Random","desc":"Wouldn't it be great to generate sets of numbers that seem more naturally distributed.","date":"2018-01-24T18:08","taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["javascript","100 days of learning"]},"twitterenable":true,"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"facebookenable":true,"toc":[{"id":"gaussian-distribution","depth":2,"text":"Gaussian Distribution"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In post one I looked a "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://steemit.com/coding/@harps116/day-1-probability","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"random walker"}]},{"type":"text","value":", a small dot that moved across the screen based on a number between 0 - 3."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Although It worked, It didn't move in a way that seemed natural.

When presented with an idea for an app or program there's normally a few questions that run through my mind: \n\n- Where do I start?\n- Do I really know how to do this?\n- What do I want this to do?\n\n### where do I start?\n\nRather than write about a program after it's complete \"in the works\" aims to explore the build process, how to tackle the problems and how to form a working program. I am pretty new to the world of programming and app development ( less than a year ) and I often struggle to know where to start. Increasingly I've noticed the more important thing is to just start. Normally I stub out a quick plan on paper, roughly defining the functionality of the program then I fire up the text editor and go for it, often ideas for new approaches will come, almost like a reward for putting in the work. \n\nI think beginning a program with a rough plan gives me that extra reference point I need. The encapsulation of ideas on paper gives me a better understanding of my initial thoughts about the program. At the moment I have just started a the project ( a pure JavaScript quiz ) and I have just begun to write the key functions of the program.\n\nHere is my inital paper plan:\n\n![paper plan](images/paper-plan.jpg?cropResize=450,450)\n\nI have been diving deeper in JavaScript and have avoided the allure of the big frameworks and decided to build a few apps in JavaScript to hopefully understand what the frameworks abstract and make easier.\n\n### do I really know how to do this? \n\nShort answer, Yes! long answer, well kinda. Let me explain, after I have a rough plan stubbed out I open up my text editor and this what I'm faced with: \n\n![](images/empty.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nLike an artist looking at a blank canvas, a writer staring a blank sheet of paper. I know I just have to start, I make an `index.html` and stub out the basic structure, at this point the headphones are on and I begin to feel in the flow state. I look at my paper plan and begin to transfer the information into the fresh `app.js` file. I ask myself as I look at the code, do I really need a quiz object? how can I make this cleaner? I wonder what's happening on twitter? I have to ignore that last question, that's the procrastination monster trying to make my life difficult.\n\nI decide that the main app file should be split into three objects, one for data ( the questions ), one for the ui ( creating DOM elements ), and one for the controller ( this the one I will return from the IIFE, as I've decided to use the [revealing module pattern](https://carldanley.com/js-revealing-module-pattern/) and wrap the three objects in one [Immediately-invoked function expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression)). Already my paper plan looks pretty crappy, but I've wrote 70 lines of code and that crappy paper plan got me there.\n\nSo now I have the data modeled: \n \n![data](images/data.png?cropResize=450,450)\n \na UI: \n \n![ui](images/ui.png?cropResize=450,450)\n \nand here's the index.html: \n \n![index](images/index.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\n\n### What do I want this app to do?\n\nOnce I can display the data,  I ask myself what else do I want this to do? At the moment here are some things I'm working on: \n \n* move to the next question \n* move to the previous question \n* check if the answer is correct \n* keep check of the score \n* make sure a radio button is selected \n\nI'm defining these methods in a controller object which is returned the main function and is the exposed [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface).\n\nThe incomplete controller object looks like this: \n\n![](images/controller.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nThe ouput is as follows:\n\n![](images/right-ans.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nI can scroll through the questions and check if the answer is correct, that's more than half of the functionality already. In part two I'll be defining more methods and maybe I'll escape the console. Along the way I've refactored this inital version as I've went, trying to stick to [DRY principals](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself) and keeping the code as clean and flexible as possible. The code will probably change more as I work, but that's what makes this medium so fun and rewarding. There are many ways to solve the same problem. Making the code as efficent and elegant as possible is something I strive to do.\n\nThe full source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/harps116/js-quiz).\n\nEmbrace the process and happy coding!","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/programming-in-the-works-part-1","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078436},"$loki":37},{"slug":"programming-in-the-works-part-2","title":"Programming ~ in the works part two","published":true,"date":"2017-07-31T11:23","taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["javascript","web development","ideas"]},"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"article":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"NewsArticle","image":{"@type":"ImageObject"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject"}}},"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$","@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Restaurant","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"}},"facebookenable":true,"person":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"person","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress"}},"event":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Event","location":{"@type":"Place"}},"musicalbum":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"MusicAlbum","byArtist":{"@type":"MusicGroup"}},"toc":[{"id":"programming-in-the-works-part-two","depth":3,"text":"Programming in the works part two"},{"id":"the-next-phase","depth":3,"text":"the next phase"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"programming-in-the-works-part-two"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#programming-in-the-works-part-two","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Programming in the works part two"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I've been plugging away at this little quiz app in my spare time.

Being an \"ideas guy\" is no help to anyone, you have to have ideas and do something about them. That is the struggle.\n\nBut this isn't a post about Philosophy, let's see how that little quiz app is growing. As [Part One](http://adamharpur.com/blog/programming-in-the-works-part-1) ended I had just figured how to check for the correct answer. \n\n### the next phase\n\nNext I added the ability to add points when the answer is correct. \"points\" being a variable available to all the code within the module. The code is wrapped in an Imediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE, this means I'm not worried about the global namespace being polluted should this app become the next internet sensation or become the hot open source project for the masses. Here's a snippet of the ```addPoints``` method which is found on the ```ui``` object:\n\n![methods](images/methods.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nYou've probably noticed the ```removeSubmit``` and ```revealSubmit``` methods, ```removeSubmit``` is called from ```addPoints``` but is only relevant when there no more questions left as it wouldn't make sense to submit the last question over and over again. The \"submit\" button is removed after every question and then added back when the next question is generated, which only happens when ```nextQuestion``` is called, which checks if the ```counter``` is still less than the amount of questions available. Here's the ```nextQuestion``` method which is a method of the ```controller``` object which handles the logic of the program:\n\n![next Question](images/nextQues.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nThis method is called indirectly by the on the submit button event which first calls ```controller.checkAnswer``` which is the only object exposed to the html and referenced as ```api.checkAnswer```. Here's a few images for clarity:\n\n![submit](images/submit.png?cropResize=450,450)\n![check answer](images/checkAnswers.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nThe ```checkAnswer``` method first grabs the inputs by tagname and then loops through those inputs and checks if one has been checked, if one is checked it will set the ```radiosIsChecked``` flag to true. Which by default is set to false. It then stores the value of that checked radio button as a variable called ```checked```.\n\nThe second part of ```checkAnswer``` involves taking the value of that checked radio ( which are created by the ```display``` function on the ```ui``` object ) turning it into a number which is then checked againist the ```quiz.questions[counter].answer``` which is a set number on the question object, remember that the ```counter``` is keeping track of the questions currently being displayed from the questions array. Using ```quiz.questions[counter].answer``` will ensure we are checking againist the correct value as ```counter``` is available throughout the module.\n\nOnce we have checked if a radio button is selected and whether it is correct or not, we can add the points if the answer is correct and continue. The next thing to check is if there is any more questions to display, we do this by making sure that the counter is less than the ```quiz.questions.length - 1``` as the counter starts at 0 this is a great way to check if there are any questions left. \n\nThe logic being if we are at the __nth__ question in an array then __n__ will be the length of the array - 1 so if __n__ equals array length -1 we know there are no more questions to display. In other words if __n__ is less than array length - 1, we can call the ```nextQuestion``` method knowing there are still questions left in the questions array.\n\n```nextQuestion``` then makes a call to ```ui.display``` which takes one argument, in this case we pass in ```counter``` which you can think of as ```questionId```. This way we can reference the question via ```counter``` in other parts of the program. Here's a visual of the ```display``` function and second part of the ```checkAnswers``` method:\n\n![check answer 2](images/checkAnswer2.png?cropResize=450,450)\n![display](images/display.png?cropResize=450,450)\n\nThe logic flow is as follows:\n\ncheck if a radio button is selected ---> check if answer is correct ---> check if theres questions left ---> yes? | | no? ---> render question ---> end quiz.\n\nThat's the mechanics done, I don't know if there's much merit writing anything about me breaking stuff in CSS ( she is a cruel mistress ).

Type: Structural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nRepresent the functionality of anoter class.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> A door can be opened in many different way, either with a code or a key card. The doors functionality is to open and can be achieved in many different ways\n\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\nSay we have a hotel room door:\n\n```ts\ninterface IDoor { \n    open(): void;\n    close(): void;\n}\n\nclass HotelRoomDoor implements IDoor { \n    open() { \n        console.log('opening door');\n    }\n\n    close() { \n        console.log('closing door');\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n```\nWhich we wanted to add some security to:\n\n```ts\nclass SecureDoor { \n    constructor(protected door: IDoor) { }\n\n    authenticate(code: number) { \n        return code === 1234;\n    }\n    open(code: number) { \n        if (this.authenticate(code)) { \n            this.door.open();\n            return\n        }\n\n        console.log('wrong passcode');\n        return\n    }\n\n    close() { \n        this.door.close()\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWe can now use the secure door as a proxy to the actual hotel door like so:\n\n\n```ts\nconst door = new SecureDoor(new HotelRoomDoor())\n\ndoor.open(4567); // wrong passcode\n\ndoor.open(1234); // opening door\ndoor.close() // closing door\n```\n\nFull Example:\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/mb81ufgr/embed/js/\"></script>\n\n","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/proxy-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078487},"$loki":40},{"slug":"reactivity-in-javascript","title":"Reactivity In JavaScript","date":"2018-05-23T18:17","desc":"How do changes in state translate to changes in the DOM?","twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"reactivity-in-js"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#reactivity-in-js","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Reactivity in JS"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"context: I have been using "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://vuejs.org/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Vue.js"}]},{"type":"text","value":"for a number of side projects and really enjoy working with it, I also use "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"http://knockoutjs.com/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Knockout.js"}]},{"type":"text","value":"a lot in work which uses a similar approach.

I wanted to dive into the abstracted functionality a little deeper to help me understand the libraries I work with.\n\nHow do changes in state translate to changes in the DOM?\n\nLet's start with a variable:\n\n`let a = 10`\n\nand another one: \n\n`let b = a * 10`\n\nthe complete picture now looks like this:\n\n```javascript\n\nlet a = 10\nlet b = a * 10\n\n```\n\nWe want `b` to always be 10 times of a. We now have a problem, when `a` changes `b` will not be aware of that change and not update, no matter what `a` is,`b` will always be the original value of `a` times 10.\n\nThis is a imperative and procedural implementation which does not solve the problem fully, what we need is an approach that is declarative and object oriented.\n\nIn an ideal world we would have a function that looked like this: \n\n```javascript\n\nonStateChanged( () => {\n   b = a * 10\n})\n\n```\n\nThis function would run every time `a` changes to update the value of `b`. So how do we implement this function? We can see that it takes a function that is then ran to set the new state.\n\n> jargon buster: a program is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of the system.\n\n[![react.png](https://s14.postimg.cc/b7icfd9o1/react.png)](https://postimg.cc/image/vrn6dupf1/)\n\n> This is an approach that React uses and why setState is always used to well.. set the state.\n\nThere is another way that involves taking the state object and converting it into a reactive object.\n\nOur `onStateChanged` function will be renamed `autorun` why will become clearer as we move through the examples.\n\nLet's implement a mini data observer and look at how Vue.js handles things.\n\nfirst we need to define accessors using the [Object.defineProperty() API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty). This will allow us later to get and set the current state.\n\n![convert.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXYQesGUkgJ2EVcGWdH1tKFo7wGAtw8v9hACRbC5Sb9TM/convert.png)\n\n[View the code]( https://jsfiddle.net/harps116/wc2e0vgv/16/ )\n\nThat seems to be working as expected, we have a few more parts to create. Later we will change the name to observe rather than convert.\n\nWe are going to create a dependency class that keeps track of the things our state depends on, it will also notify those that depend on it that it has changed.\n\n![dep.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVjNcmz6vjhJhSbjhbisgdHeWKntN1ezUQtnQuzB4Z5xm/dep.png)\n\n![dep-2.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWb7LoH3tqzyzYRB9reE4N946rgsYYBYRvR64RMghMCfj/dep-2.png)\n\n[View the code](https://jsfiddle.net/harps116/7wf1vc2j/16/)\n\nThis of course is not the complete picture and a simplified version of the general idea. Notice the wrappedUpdate. This is a little trick to ensure that the correct function is added to the subscribers list. As it is assigned to the activeUpdate which our dependency instance checks for in its depend method, we can ensure that what we add to the subscribers list is currently active. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\n![3.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmU9uNzVuRC6xFwjikr3sD2XLyU4bJLPu3UjJvWwjLCJND/3.png)\n![3.2.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmccyMkujPF8CqmGqunJY43H6hbYwH9vUuxaaAy91GkzfX/3.2.png)\n![3.3.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNyz6mtQmaYaFkGsHLtqCzQfHviMtX8sbFNdEAxhZw4Pp/3.3.png)\n\n[View the code](https://jsfiddle.net/harps116/gL46sfxs/4/)\n\nRead through the code and play around with the state. You see it log out the changes.\n\nYou can read more about reactivity in Vue [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).\n\nThis idea may change a little in up coming version of Vue.

previous post you can find [here](https://steemit.com/programming/@harps116/getting-sassy-with-sass-css-s-wiser-uncle). I went over how to install and setup Sass using Ruby aswell as the basic project structure, since that post I have came across away to use Sass with Node. \n\nThe steps are lined out in this [post](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/watch-and-compile-sass-in-five-quick-steps--cms-28275) by Zviad Sichinava. Since I am already using NodeJS in my workflow I've made the switch.\n\nOf course you can use task runners such as [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) or [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) to get the job done, but there is really no need for the overhead if you are just playing around with Sass's functionality. I've found that build tools can become a bit of a rabbit hole and you often times spend more time on setting up build tools than actually writing code, this up front cost is worth it on bigger projects but not really for small or medium ventures.\n\nFor reference I am assuming you project folder is as follows: \n```bash\n\n\nindex.html\n|\ncss/styles.css\n|\n|--scss/ \n|    |-- partials/                   \n|    |    |-- _base.scss\n|    |    |--_variables.scss\n|    |    |--_mixins.scss\n|    |-- styles.scss     \n|----♦ ♦ ♦-----♦ ♦ ♦------ Other folders unrelated to this tutorial\n|--js/\n|--img/\n|\nX\n\n\n\n```\n\n## Your recipe to get the most from Sass.\n\nHead over to github and grab the repo if you would like to follow along: [resource](https://github.com/harps116/learn-sass).\n\n{ If you don't know what git or github is check out this [post](https://steemit.com/programming/@jfuenmayor96/what-is-github-why-should-you-use-it-in-your-project) by a fellow steemer @jfuenmayor96. He has a great series on getting to grips with git. }\n\nNavigate to the freshly cloned repo and run ```npm install``` and you should be good to go, I'm assuming you have Node and NPM installed and know how to work a computer.  You can also run ```npm i``` to really feel like a badass.\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables in Sass are like variables in any other language they hold values that can be used anywhere throughout the project, although strictly speaking they are more like constants than variables as there is no reassignment, but thats a story for another post. This one feature of Sass should be enough to justify trying it out, (no more looking up Hex codes).\n\nI mainly use variables for things like colors, fonts and occasionaly spacing. Here's a quick example: \n\n![sass-1.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUbL52W9QJoETDvQNkHW6cfLEFFauEPcz4LdS3YxB4Afy/sass-1.png)\n\n```\n/*Note: remember the more descriptive the variable\nnames the better, they should describe what they hold.*/\n\n/*importing the font from google*/\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro');\n\n/*define the colors*/\n$light-blue: #469ef3;\n$dark-blue: #154e9a;\n\n/*define the font*/\n$font: \"Source Sans Pro\", sans-serif;\n$font-size: 5em;\n```\n\nVariables always start with ```$``` in Sass which is the convention in many other languages so it shouldn't be too out of the ordinary. You can find the completed project for reference in the sass-starter-reference folder if you get lost or want to skip ahead and get going right away.\n\nYou can also do math with variables and pass them into Sass's build in functions ( you can make your own functions that's coming up next ) here's a list of the toys that Sass comes with out of the box: [functions list](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html)\n\nEach sub-folder will have access to the set of node_modules at the root of the folder and you can run from the root ```npm run sass``` to watch and compile the sass in the sass-starter and ```npm run sass-ref```  for the reference. However the ```npm run sass``` will not do anything at this stage, patience young padawan.\n\n### Mixins\n\nMixins! Get excited for mixins they are a very fun and exciting, really they are very useful, once you have an arsenal or mixins at your disposal you will be surprised how quick you can go from concept to design.  Infact there are mixin libraries such as [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/). Bourbon is superb and also has its own set of sub libraries that are on the website if you wish to explore them ( I encourage you to do so ). There is also a huge suite of mixins called [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) which has a ton of features. \n\nMixins are essentially functions that you pass parameters into and a value is returned that can be used to style an element. They aren't technically functions because their function is to generate code at compile time not execute code at run time, templates maybe? Macros? Whatever they are, they are a core factor in the enjoyment of using Sass.\n\nLet's continue working on our starter project, add this to ```/sass-starter/scss/partials/_mixins.scss```\n\n![sass-2.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcXihj8RyF75gppmPXyCXEQ4ZgwinaLokAsTdriqPj8fw/sass-2.png)\n\n```css\n/*with mixins we use the @mixin keyword to tell \nthe compiler that it is approaching a mixin,\nwe then define the values and properties inside\nthe mixin.*/\n\n@mixin size($width, $height: $width) {\n  width: $width;\n  height: $height;\n}\n\n@mixin center($width) {\n  max-width: $width;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that ```npm run sass``` is still not working at this point, we will fix that in the next section, we will also see how the above mixins work. they are fairly contrived examples, I'd recommend checking out [this post](https://www.sitepoint.com/sass-mixins-kickstart-project/) on mixins to really see their power.\n\n## Nesting and using Sass\n\nIt's about time we actually started styling something, notice in the index.html file that there are only  four classes that we will be styling ```main```  ```main-img``` ```main-text```  ```inner-text```.\n\nWith nesting you can style elements that are within other elements. Let's look at a example, we will also be using those mixins we made earlier. First we have to hook up our base partial to the `styles.scss` which is the entry point to Scss folder and what node-sass is watching. \n\n![sass-3.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmThgVZojvEjBsY4tSmrQLWa68fFHLfDXQzipzG2umtDZo/sass-3.png)\n\n```css\n// modules and variables\n@import \"partials/base\";\n```\n\n#### _Quick Side Note_\n\n> It's worth noting that in larger projects you can also put all your partials in the ```styles.scss``` or entry point to your scss , the order is important with the lower imports having access to the ones above it, but not the other way around. Below is an example from another project to give you an idea of what I mean.\n\n![sass-7.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY1XAWQna54Z13FHURWfsakW7kunyJhAGui66mWwNbwUC/sass-7.png)\n\n### Back to it\n\nThe _base.scss can now be seen by node-sass, next we can hook in the mixins and variables we made earlier to the the _base.scss file and add some styling that will be applied to our webpage.\n\nOnce the two top import statements are added we can now head over to the terminal and run ```npm run sass```, now the node-sass module is watch for changes on the styles.scss which hooked into the _base.scss which is hooked into the _variables.scss and the _mixins.scss. Hopefully you can picture how this is all working.\n\nLet's look at our finished styles.scss file. Notice how we are passing in values to our mixins and using our variables.\n\n![sass-4.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSctgi8jYhpqJGRWBpPQexuywPWcez5HMuZa7iVEE6LEG/sass-4.png)\n```css\n/*Note: that we are importing the files that \nwe need and are using in this base file,\nthe SassScript compiler automatically \nremoves the _ prefix from any files in the partials folder,\nif we want to use a mixin we can use the @include syntax*/\n\n// modules and variables\n@import \"variables\";\n@import \"mixins\";\n\n.main {\n  @include center(30em);\n  @include size(50%, 25%);\n  display: flex;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  color: $dark-blue;\n\n  .main-text {\n    margin-top: 1.25em;\n    font-family: $font;\n    font-size: $font-size;\n    .inner-text {\n      color: $light-blue;\n    }\n  }\n  .main-img {\n    @include size(9em);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is what this file will compile to: \n\n![sass-5.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQtV8fjAYu9QZsRZuw5xETnMuf1C9V5RxZtmqSBSE6jCs/sass-5.png)\n\nOpen up the index.html and you should get the following output: \n\n![sass-6.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRPGiRTn1UZo8R9nWjocC8QYV34qopAiN6ScAVVNiXjd7/sass-6.png)\n\n\n### Other areas worth exploring and links to resources:\n\n-

Luckily sequelize makes it possible to use SQL and not feel like you've left JavaScript land. \n \nLet's look at a basic example to get up and running. You will need: \n \n* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) \n* [sqlite](http://sqlite.org/download.html) \n* [a text editor](http://blog.liveedu.tv/10-best-text-editors-programming-2016/) \n \nOnce everything is installed fire up a terminal ( on Linux or Mac ) or command prompt in Windows and make your project directory ( I'm on Linux here so these commands will not work on Windows ): \n \n1.Make a directory --> enter that directory --> make two files one for our script ( app.js ) and one to hold the data ( test.sqlite ) --> create a package.json file for our dependencies \n \nnote: the '-y' flag on npm init will stub out a default package.json perfect for testing. \n \n![](./images/setup.png)\n \n2.install our dependencies \n \n![](./images/setup2.png) <br/> \n![](./images/setup3.png) \n  \nnote: the sqlite module will not be used directly but is used by the sequelize module, '-S' on npm install is shorthand for '--save', this will add the dependency to the package.json file you can also us 'i' instead of 'install'.  \n \nWe're all set, we can now start to write in our app.js file. Fire up your favourite text editor and code along.\n \n3.Grab the sequelize module --> create an instance of a sequelize object which we'll call 'con' short for connection which is what the instance represents. \n \n![](./images/1.png)\n \n4.Call the define method on that instance to define a table called article, note the proprieties of this object represent column names and the values are the data types. \n \n![](./images/2.png)\n \n5.Call the sync method on the connection instance and then ( sequelize uses JavaScript promises more on that [here](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261)) call the create method on the table we defined above.  \n \n![](./images/3.png)\n \n6.Call sync and query the table that will be created when we run the script. I have used both the findAll and findById methods here findById is commented out feel free to play around here and see what queries you can come up with. One thing to note is that sequelize automatically pluralises queries that return many results. I.e. article is articles. \n \n![](./images/4.png)\n \n7.Now we can return to the terminal ( make sure your in the project directory ) and enter 'node app.js'.  \n \n![](./images/5.png)\n \nNotice how we can see the SQL queries being logged in the terminal. This is the leg work that sequelize is doing for us behind the scenes. \n \n8.We can double check that everything has worked correctly by using a tool like SQLite manager which is a firefox extension perfect for messing around with sqlite database in the browser. \n \n![](./images/6.png)\n \nThis is a very basic example, but does cover the most basic steps to get you up and running.

In the spirit of jumping on bandwagons this is my note to self. I have been doing some thinking over the last few weeks and have tried to identify some things I would like to learn and participate in this year.\n\n## Looking back \n\n2018 was my year as a professional developer and I have made some massive leaps in my practical knowledge and my ability to contribute to projects. This year:\n\n* I got to grips with React\n* Starting using TDD practices\n* Maintained my own code bases in work\n* Became a scrum master\n* Read over 10 books on both programming and other topics\n* Completed 5 programming courses\n* Raised a beautiful a little boy\n* Managed to work out at least twice a week\n\nMany of the goals I set around [this time last year](https://adam.harpur.io/blog/starting-2018) have been achieved and now I am ready to adjust and get 2019 started.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThis year I'm ready to move past a junior developer and make myself a key part of any team I find myself in. To do that I plan on learning some bigger concepts and really focus on design pattern and architecture. I will attempt to clone some popular websites to learn what it takes to make a successful app. \n\nThey say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it's also a really good way to hone skills and learn the process behind making some of the webs most popular apps.\n\nThe categories I will be exploring: \n\n*     Crowdfunding\n*     Classifieds and eCommerce\n*     Jobs board\n*     Multi-blogging\n*     News: news blocks/portals, river of news, social news\n*     Social photo sharing/ visual social networking/ image and video hosting\n*     Q+A (question and answer)\n*     Social bookmarking and visual social bookmarking\n*     Real-world social discovery\n*     Micro-blogging\n*     URL shortening\n\nThey will be slimmed down a fair bit, but it will give me an idea of some of the problems that needed to be solved in order for the apps to work correctly. Hopefully combining this with learning some design patterns will give some more practical tools and techniques I can use in my day to day work. \n\nI have chosen to pair down my goals and really just focus on these two things with the thought that deeper dives will give the most benefit to my current skill set.\n\n\n","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/starting-2019","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078595},"$loki":49},{"slug":"state-pattern","title":"The State Pattern","date":"2019-07-04T01:43","desc":"The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way.

Name: Command\n\n## Name: State\n\n## Type: Behavioural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\nChange the behavior of a class when the state changes.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass. The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.\nReal World Example:\n\n> \nTypescript Code Example:\n\nAn example of the state patterns use case is a text editor, it lets you change the state of text that is being typed, i.e. if you have selected bold, it starts writing in bold, if italic then in italics etc.\n\nFirst of all we have our state interface and some state implementations\n\n```ts\ninterface WritingState{\n    write(words: string) : void;\n}\n\nclass UpperCase implements WritingState{\n    write(words: string){\n        console.log(words.toUpperCase());\n    }\n}\n\nclass LowerCase implements WritingState{\n    write(words: string){\n        console.log(words.toLowerCase())\n    }\n}\n\nclass DefaultText implements WritingState{\n    write(words: string){\n        console.log(words)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe Editor:\n\n```ts\nclass TextEditor{\n    protected state : WritingState;\n\n    constructor(state: WritingState){\n        this.state = state;\n    }\n\n    public setState(state: WritingState){\n        this.state = state;\n    }\n\n    public type(words: string){\n        this.state.write(words);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```ts\nconst editor = new TextEditor(new DefaultText());\n\neditor.type('First line');\n\neditor.setState(new UpperCase());\n\neditor.type('Second line');\neditor.type('Third line');\n\neditor.setState(new LowerCase());\n\neditor.type('Fourth line');\n\n// Output:\n// First line\n// SECOND LINE\n// THIRD LINE\n// fourth line\n// fifth line\n```\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/qphyzjva/1/embed/js/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/state-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078607},"$loki":50},{"slug":"steering-behaviour","title":"Steering Behaviour","media_order":"auto_2.png,auto_1.png","date":"2018-09-22T09:28","desc":"The goal of this post is to examine simulations where the objects make decisions.","taxonomy":{"category":["blog"],"tag":["p5"]},"twitterenable":true,"twittercardoptions":"summary","articleenabled":false,"musiceventenabled":false,"orgaenabled":false,"orga":{"ratingValue":2.5},"orgaratingenabled":false,"eventenabled":false,"personenabled":false,"musicalbumenabled":false,"productenabled":false,"product":{"ratingValue":2.5},"restaurantenabled":false,"restaurant":{"acceptsReservations":"yes","priceRange":"$"},"facebookenable":true,"toc":[{"id":"autonomous-agents-and-steering","depth":2,"text":"Autonomous Agents and Steering"},{"id":"what-is-meant-by-autonomous-agent","depth":3,"text":"What is meant by autonomous agent?"},{"id":"steering","depth":3,"text":"Steering"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"autonomous-agents-and-steering"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#autonomous-agents-and-steering","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Autonomous Agents and Steering"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The goal of this post is to examine simulations where the objects make decisions."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Previously I had looked at the way forces act on objects.

In this post I wanted to explore objects that aren't inanimate and have some ability to make a choice about their behaviour.\n\nThis will start with a quick look at some initial considerations and basic examples:\n\n### What is meant by autonomous agent?\n\n* limited ability to perceive it's environment\n* process the environment and calculate an action\n* the calculation then results in a force being applied to it\n* no global plan or leader\n\nThese agents or vehicle's operate in three steps:\n\n1. action selection\n1. steering\n1. locomotion\n\nThey will have a desired velocity, they will want to do something, once that is established a steering force will then be calculated. Once the force is calculated it will then be applied to the object.\n\nThese are the basic ingredients that will create the vehicle:\n\n\n### Steering\n\n\nLet's look at a simple scenario. We are going to establish a scenario where our vehicle seeks a target.\n\n![](auto_1.png)\n\nIn the drawing above we a have a vehicle that has a velocity and a target. The action being selected is a `seeking` behaviour. Here is how we will calculate steering.\n\n\n```\nsteering = desire - velocity\n\n```\n\nOn the surface this looks like a very simple formula.However the `desire` variable is one that will need some thought to determine. In this case the desired velocity is towards the target at `maxspeed`, we will create a vector that points at the target.\n\n\nHere is how the vector is calculated. The desired velocity is established by creating a vector that is the result of `target - location`.The magnitude of the vector is set to it's established `maxspeed`. \n\nThe steering is then calculated like so `desire - velocity`. The steering force is limited in some way and then the force `maxforce` is applied to send the vehicle to the target.\n\n![](auto_2.png)\n\nHere are those steps encapsulated in code:\n\n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"MqRKqy\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-pen-title=\"Seeking Behaviour Example\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/MqRKqy/\">Seeking Behaviour Example</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nAs you can see the vehicle follows the mouse position, play around with the numbers and watch the behaviour change. `maxforce` and `maxspeed` will have the biggest impact.\n\nOnce the vehicle gets to it's target, currently it just continues and will then have to turn and head back. It would be nicer if it could sense that the target was approaching and slow down.\n\nThe key to this is to think about the vehicles desired velocity at any given point. This so far has always to be set to `maxpeed`. \n\nIf we imagined that the target has a boundary around it, another circle with a larger radius than the target and the same centre point. We could set a rule that would say:\n\n> if the vehicle is outside the boundary the vehicles desired velocity has a magnitude of `maxspeed`.\n\nOnce inside the boundary the rules change a bit:\n\n> if at the edge of the boundary magnitude = `maxspeed`,if on the target magnitude = 0, with points in between falling somewhere between those two numbers dependent on location.\t\n\nTo calculate this, the distance between the location and target is needed. Which we then can apply to the magnitude using a map function.\n\n> speed = map( `distance`, 0, `boundary radius`, 0, `maxspeed` )\n\nThis will map the distance from target to current magnitude. So the final approach is this:\n\n> if the distance is greater than the radius of the boundary it is at `maxspeed`, if the distance is less that the boundary radius it is some range between 0 and `maxspeed`.\n\n<p data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"jvRqyV\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"harps116\" data-pen-title=\"Seeking Behaviour with arrival Example\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116/pen/jvRqyV/\">Seeking Behaviour with arrival Example</a> by Adam Harpur (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/harps116\">@harps116</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nWith a few adjustments to the previous example we can set the vehicle to slow down and stop when approaching the target.\n\nThat was a quick look at autonomous agents.

Name: Template\n\n## Type: Behavioural\n\n## Use when you want to:\n\ndefine a skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, and defer the implementation of those steps to the children classes\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n> In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.\n\n \nReal World Example:\n\n> Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like\n\n        * Prepare the base of house\n        * Build the walls\n        * Add roof\n        * Add other floors\n\nThe order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.\n\n\nIn the example we are imagining that we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on the test server.\n\nFirst of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm\n\n```ts\nabstract class Builder {\n    build(){\n        this.test();\n        this.lint();\n        this.assemble();\n        this.deploy();\n    }\n\n    abstract test(): void;\n    abstract lint(): void ;\n    abstract assemble(): void;\n    abstract deploy(): void\n}\n\n```\n\nThe implementations:\n\n```ts\nclass AndroidBuilder extends Builder{\n    test(){     \n        console.log('Running android tests');\n    }\n\n    lint(){\n         console.log('Linting the android code');\n    }\n\n    assemble(){\n         console.log('Assembling the android build');\n    }\n\n    deploy(){\n         console.log('Deploying android build to server');\n    }\n}\n\nclass IosBuilder extends Builder{\n    test(){\n        console.log('Running ios tests');\n    }\n\n    lint(){\n        console.log('Linting the ios code');\n    }\n\n    assemble(){\n        console.log('Assembling the ios build');\n    }\n\n    deploy(){\n        console.log('Deploying ios build to server');\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nUsage:\n\n```ts\n\nconst androidBuilder = new AndroidBuilder();\nandroidBuilder.build();\n\n// Output:\n// Running android tests\n// Linting the android code\n// Assembling the android build\n// Deploying android build to server\n\nconst iosBuilder = new IosBuilder();\niosBuilder.build();\n\n// Output:\n// Running ios tests\n// Linting the ios code\n// Assembling the ios build\n// Deploying ios build to server\n```\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/ofkdt6rz/2/embed/js/\"></script>","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/template-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078639},"$loki":53},{"slug":"the-humanness-of-programs","title":"The Humanness of programs","date":"2018-04-11T18:16","desc":"0110100001100101011011000110110001101111,Even something as simple as hello can seem strange and alien in machine language.

A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.\n\nReal World Example:\n\n> A zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them create a sound\n\nTypescript Code Example:\n\n```ts\n// Visitee\ninterface Animal {\n    accept(operation: AnimalOperation);\n}\n\n// Visitor\ninterface AnimalOperation {\n    visitMonkey(monkey: Monkey);\n    visitLion(lion: Lion);\n    visitDolphin(dolphin: Dolphin);\n}\n```\nImplementation\n```ts\n\nclass Monkey implements Animal {\n    public shout() {\n        console.log('Ooh oo aa aa!');\n    }\n\n    public accept(operation: AnimalOperation) {\n        operation.visitMonkey(this);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Lion implements Animal {\n    public roar() {\n        console.log('Roaaar!');\n    }\n\n    public accept(operation: AnimalOperation) {\n        operation.visitLion(this);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dolphin implements Animal {\n    public speak() {\n        console.log('Tuut tuttu tuutt!');\n    }\n\n    public accept(operation: AnimalOperation) {\n        operation.visitDolphin(this);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nimplement our visitor to add jump and sound behaviour:\n```ts\n\nclass Speak implements AnimalOperation {\n    public visitMonkey(monkey: Monkey) {\n        monkey.shout();\n    }\n\n    public visitLion(lion: Lion) {\n        lion.roar();\n    }\n\n    public visitDolphin(dolphin: Dolphin) {\n        dolphin.speak();\n    }\n}\n\nclass Jump implements AnimalOperation {\n    public visitMonkey(monkey: Monkey) {\n        console.log('Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!')\n    }\n\n    public visitLion(lion: Lion) {\n        console.log('Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!')\n    }\n\n    public visitDolphin(dolphin: Dolphin) {\n        console.log('Walked on water a little and disappeared')\n    }\n}\n```\nUsage:\n```ts\nconst monkey = new Monkey()\nconst lion = new Lion()\nconst dolphin = new Dolphin()\n\nconst speak = new Speak()\nconst jump = new Jump()\n\nmonkey.accept(speak)   // Ooh oo aa aa!\nmonkey.accept(jump)    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!\n\nlion.accept(speak)     // Roaaar!\nlion.accept(jump)      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground! \n\ndolphin.accept(speak)  // Tuut tutt tuutt! \ndolphin.accept(jump)   // Walked on water a little and disappeared\n```\n\n<script async src=\"//jsfiddle.net/harps116/cr5gwks1/3/embed/js/\"></script>\n","dir":"/archive","path":"/archive/visitor-pattern","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078680},"$loki":57},{"slug":"lists-list-more-lists","title":"singly linked list","date":"2021-12-13T06:52","desc":"The world is swarming in lists, to-dos, shopping, sprint backlogs.

This piece of additional information let's Rust know how to work with the data.\n\nRust is [statically typed](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/22321/statically-typed), meaning that it must know all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. \n\nSometimes there are cases where the value can be parsed from a say a string to a number and therefore there could be potentially a number of types associated with that value. In those cases type annotation is important.\n\n```rust\nlet meaning_of_life: u32 = \"42\".parse().expect(\"Not a number!\");\n```\n\nWithout type annotation Rust will display the following:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo build\n   Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)\nerror[E0282]: type annotations needed\n --> src/main.rs:2:9\n  |\n2 |     let meaning_of_life = \"42\".parse().expect(\"Not a number!\");\n  |         ^^^^^ consider giving `meaning_of_life` a type\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0282`.\nerror: could not compile `no_type_annotations`.\n\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\n\n```\n\nHere, the compiler is letting us know it needs more information on the intended data type of the parsed string.\n\n## Scalar Types\n\nA [scalar](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16441/scalar) type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:\n\n* integars\n* floating-point numbers\n* Booleans\n* characters\n\nThese are pretty common across programming languages, here is a quick refresher:\n\n### Integer\n\nAn integer is a number without a fractional component. The table below shows the built-in integer types in Rust. Each variant in the [Signed and Unsigned](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/commprogramming/int_dat_typ.html) columns (for example, i16) can be used to declare the type of an integer value. Below are examples of integer types in Rust.\n```bash\n| length | signed | unsigned |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |\n| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |\n| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |\n| 64-bit | i64    | u128     |\n| arch   | isize  | usize    |\n```\n\nThe isize and usize types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture\n\n### Integer Literals\n\nYou can write integers in any of the forms outlined below\n```bash\n| number literals | example    |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| decimal         | 78_678     |\n| hex             | 0xff       |\n| octal           | 0o77       |\n| binary          | 0b1111_0000|\n| byte (u8 only)  | b'A'       |\n```\nRust defaults integers to `i32` (which will cover the majority of cases), this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which you’d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection. \n\n### Floating-Point Types\n\nRust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision.\n\nHere’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = 2.0; // f64\n\n    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32\n}\n```\n\nFloating-point numbers are represented according to the [IEEE-754 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754). The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.\n\n### Numeric Operations\n\nRust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. The following code shows how you’d use each one in a let statement:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // addition\n    let sum = 5 + 10;\n\n    // subtraction\n    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;\n\n    // multiplication\n    let product = 4 * 30;\n\n    // division\n    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;\n\n    // remainder\n    let remainder = 43 % 5;\n}\n```\nEach expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. See [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/appendix-02-operators.html) for a full list of operators.\n\n\n### Boolean\n\nAs in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool. For example:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let t = true;\n\n    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation\n}\n```\n\nBoolean types are typically used in control flows such as `if` statements.\n\n### Character Type\n\nRust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type, and the following code shows one way to use it. (Note that char literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.)\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let c = 'z';\n    let z = 'ℤ';\n    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';\n}\n```\n\nRu jst’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a char is in Rust.\n\n## Compound Types\n\nCompound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.\n\n### Tuple Type\n\nA tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.\n\nWe create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional type annotations in this example:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\n}\n```\nThe variable tup binds to the entire tuple, because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);\n\n    let (x, y, z) = tup;\n\n    println!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\n}\n```\noutput:\n\n```bash\nThe value of y is: 6.4\n```\nThis program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then uses a pattern with let to take tup and turn it into three separate variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called __destructuring__, because it breaks the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of y, which is 6.4.\n\nIn addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\n\n    let five_hundred = x.0;\n\n    let six_point_four = x.1;\n\n    let one = x.2;\n}\n```\nThis program creates a tuple, `x`, and then makes new variables for each element by using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.\n\n### Array Type\n\nAnother way to collect values is an array. Every element in an array must be of the same type (unlike a tuple).\n\nArrays in Rust are different from arrays in other languages because arrays have a fixed length, like tuples.\n\nValues going into an array are written as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n}\n```\nArrays are useful when data is to stored on the stack rather than the heap ([more on stack and heap](https://medium.com/@nickolasteixeira/stack-vs-heap-whats-the-difference-and-why-should-i-care-5abc78da1a88)) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.  An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector. I will look at vectors in a future post.\n\nAn example of when you might want to use an array rather than a vector is in a program that needs to know the names of the months of the year. It’s very unlikely that such a program will need to add or remove months, so you can use an array because you know it will always contain 12 elements:\n\n```rust\nlet months = [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\",\n              \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"];\n\n```\n\nYou would write an array’s type by using square brackets, and within the brackets include the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:\n\n```rust\nlet months: [&str; 12] = [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\",\n              \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"];\n```\n\nWriting an array’s type this way looks similar to an alternative syntax for initializing an array: if you want to create an array that contains the same value for each element, you can specify the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:\n\n```rust\nlet a = [3; 5];\n\n```\nThe array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value `3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a more concise way.\n\n### Accessing Array Elements\n\nAn array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n    let first = a[0];\n    let second = a[1];\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the variable named `first` will get the value `1`, because that is the value at index `[0]` in the array. The variable named second will get the value `2` from index `[1]` in the array.\n\n### Invalid Array Element Access\n\nWhat happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array? Say you change the example to the following code, which will compile but exit with an error when it runs:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let index = 10;\n\n    let element = a[index];\n\n    println!(\"The value of element is: {}\", element);\n}\n```\n\nRunning this code using `cargo run` produces the following result:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling arrays v0.1.0 (file:///projects/arrays)\nerror: this operation will panic at runtime\n --> src/main.rs:5:19\n  |\n5 |     let element = a[index];\n  |                   ^^^^^^^^ index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10\n  |\n  = note: `#[deny(unconditional_panic)]` on by default\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nerror: could not compile `arrays`.\n\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\n```\nThe compilation didn’t produce any errors, but the program resulted in a __runtime__ error and didn’t exit successfully. When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the array length, Rust will panic.\n\nThis is the an example of Rust’s safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed, which can lead to a number or issues like a [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow).\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/rust-data-types","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078731},"$loki":59},{"slug":"rust-functions","title":"functions in rust","date":"2020-12-19T07:02","desc":"A look at basic building blocks of rust","tags":["rust"],"toc":[{"id":"function-parameters","depth":3,"text":"Function Parameters"},{"id":"function-bodies","depth":3,"text":"Function Bodies"},{"id":"functions-with-return-values","depth":3,"text":"Functions with Return Values"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Functions are everywhere in Rust code.

The most important function in the language is a function called `main`, which is the entry to many programs. Another key word to take note of is the `fn` keyword, which is a way to declare new functions.\n\nRust uses [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) as the convention in function and variable names. Quick example of a couple of functions including `main`:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n\n    another_function();\n}\n\nfn another_function() {\n    println!(\"Another function.\");\n}\n```\nFunction definitions in Rust start with fn and have a set of parentheses after the function name. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.\n\nWe can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function` after the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere.\n\n### Function Parameters\n\nSome function will have parameters as part of the functions signature. When concrete values are passed (technically called arguments) those values are used within the function.\n\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    another_function(5);\n}\n\nfn another_function(x: i32) {\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of `x` is specified as `i32`. When 5 is passed to another_function, the `println!` macro puts 5 where the pair of curly brackets were in the format string.\n\nIn function signatures the type of argument a function should expect is required. This is a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.\n\nWhen you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like so:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    another_function(5, 6);\n}\n\nfn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n    println!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\n}\n```\n\n### Function Bodies\n\nFunction bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, we’ve only covered functions without an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions.\n\n__Statements__ are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. __Expressions__ evaluate to a resulting value.\n\nCreating a variable and assigning a value to it with the `let` keyword is a statement. `let y = 6;` is a statement.\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let y = 6;\n}\n```\nFunction definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.\n\nStatements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a let statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = (let y = 6);\n}\n```\nWhen you run this program, the error you’ll get looks like this:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)\nerror: expected expression, found statement (`let`)\n --> src/main.rs:2:14\n  |\n2 |     let x = (let y = 6);\n  |              ^^^\n  |\n  = note: variable declaration using `let` is a statement\n```\n\nThe `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for `x` to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages, you can write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the value 6; that is not the case in Rust.\n\nExpressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of the code that you’ll write in Rust. Consider a simple math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which is an expression that evaluates to the value `11`. Expressions can be part of statements: below, the 6 in the statement `let y = 6;` is an expression that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes, `{}`, is an expression, for example:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n\n    let y = {\n        let x = 3;\n        x + 1\n    };\n\n    println!(\"The value of y is: {}\", y);\n}\n\n```\n\ntake note of this block:\n\n```rust\n{\n    let x = 3;\n    x + 1\n}\n\n```\n\n\nIn this case, evaluates to `4`. That value gets bound to y as part of the let statement. Note the `x + 1` line without a semicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value.\n\n### Functions with Return Values\n\nFunctions can return values to the code that calls them. Return types are not named, but their values are declared using the an arrow `->`. In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return from a function early by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value. Most functions however return the last expression implicitly. For example:\n\n```rust\nfn five() -> i32 {\n    5\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = five();\n\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n}\n```\nThere are no function calls, macros, or even `let` statements in the `five` function—just the number `5` by itself. Which is a perfectly valid function in Rust. Note that the functions return type is specified as `-> i32`. \n\nThe `5` in `five` is the function’s return value, which is why the return type is `i32`.\n\nAnother example:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = plus_one(5);\n\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n}\n\nfn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {\n    x + 1\n}\n```\n\nRunning this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. But if we place a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from an expression to a statement, we’ll get an error.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\n --> src/main.rs:7:24\n  |\n7 | fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {\n  |    --------            ^^^ expected `i32`, found `()`\n  |    |\n  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression\n8 |     x + 1;\n  |          - help: consider removing this semicolon\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.\nerror: could not compile `functions`.\n\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\n```\nThe main error message, “mismatched types,” reveals the core issue with this code. The definition of the function plus_one says that it will return an i32, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by (), an empty tuple. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to possibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which would fix the error.","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/rust-functions","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078756},"$loki":60},{"slug":"rust-variables-and-mutability","title":"variables and mutability in rust","date":"2020-12-11T11:02","desc":"A look at basic building blocks of rust","tags":["rust"],"toc":[{"id":"first-steps","depth":2,"text":"First Steps"},{"id":"variables-vs-constants","depth":2,"text":"Variables vs Constants"},{"id":"shadowing","depth":2,"text":"Shadowing"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"first-steps"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#first-steps","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"First Steps"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Variables in rust are "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/immutable","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"immutable"}]},{"type":"text","value":" by default. a helpful hint by the language to write code that is easy to follow and avoid any unwanted side effects are reduced."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Once a immutable variable is bound to a name, it cannot change.

Steps\n\nVariables in rust are [immutable](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/immutable) by default. a helpful hint by the language to write code that is easy to follow and avoid any unwanted side effects are reduced.\n\nOnce a immutable variable is bound to a name, it cannot change. Let's have a quick look at what that means.\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n    x = 6;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n}\n\n```\nThe above code will not compile. We are trying to change the value of `x` from 5 to 6. The compiler will complain pretty loudly in fact.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\nerror[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`\n --> src/main.rs:4:5\n  |\n2 |     let x = 5;\n  |         -\n  |         |\n  |         first assignment to `x`\n  |         help: make this binding mutable: `mut x`\n3 |     println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n4 |     x = 6;\n  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.\nerror: could not compile `variables`.\n\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\n\n```\nThis is a good thing, the compiler is nudging you to solving the issue at hand. Take note of the following message: `cannot assign twice to immutable variable x`.\n\nNow we know we have two options to achieve the desired output. We can either create a new immutable variable and assign `6` to it. Or, we can make `x` mutable. If we want to make `x` mutable we can add the `mut` keyword to the variable declaration.\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 5;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n    x = 6;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n}\n\n```\nWe can now run the program\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s\n     Running `target/debug/variables`\nThe value of x is: 5\nThe value of x is: 6\n```\nIn some cases, you’ll want to make a variable mutable because it makes the code more convenient to write than if it had only immutable variables.\n\nThere are always going to be trade offs when choosing to make things immutable or mutable. For instance if the data structure was particularly large it may make sense to mutate in place rather than save a copy and re-allocate the data. With small data it may make sense to create new instances of the data and writing it in a more functional style, the drop in performance may a price worth paying for legibility.\n\n## Variables vs Constants\n\nHaving an immutable variable may sound like that variable is really a constant. However in rust constants cannot be marked as mutable using `mut`. They are always immutable.\n\nYou declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of let as you would with a variable. You also must annotate a type. They can be declared in any scope including the global scope which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.\n\nThe last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.\n\nBelow is how you would declare a constant for `MAX` with a value set to 100,000.\n\n```rust\nconst MAX: u32 = 100_000\n```\nConstants stick around for the entire time a program runs within the scope in which it is declared. These values are the non-changing hardcoded values like `SPEED_OF_SOUND` or `HOURS_IN_DAY`. They let maintainers know that these values are intentionally hardcoded. It also allows these values to be changed in one place, should they need to be updated in the future.\n\n## Shadowing\n\nYou can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable. The first variable is __shadowed__ by the second. This means the second variables value is what appears when the variable is used. A quick example:\n\n`src/main.rs`\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n\n    let x = x + 1;\n\n    let x = x * 2;\n\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {}\", x);\n}\n```\n\nThis program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then it shadows `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so the value of `x` is then `6`. The third let statement also shadows `x`, multiplying the previous value by `2` to give `x` a final value of `12`. When we run this program, it will output the following:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s\n     Running `target/debug/variables`\nThe value of x is: 12\n\n```\nShadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`. We would get a compile-time error\nif we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. Using `let` we can perform transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have occurred.\n\nThe other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:\n\n```rust\nlet spaces = \"   \";\nlet spaces = spaces.len();\n```\nThis is valid as we use the keyword `let` which ensures the second `spaces` is a brand new variable. This saves us the need to come up with new names for each assignment, like `spaces_str` or `spaces_num`. Note that using `mut` will not achieve the desired outcome:\n\n```rust\n    let mut spaces = \"   \";\n    spaces = spaces.len();\n```\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\n --> src/main.rs:3:14\n  |\n3 |     spaces = spaces.len();\n  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.\nerror: could not compile `variables`.\n\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\n```\nI'll be looking at data types next","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/rust-variables-and-mutability","extension":".md","createdAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-25T09:53:57.142Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1608890078777},"$loki":61},{"slug":"thinking-out-loud","title":"thinking out loud","date":"2020-11-30T08:52","desc":"Some thoughts and ideas as I begin to write again","tags":["meta"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It's been a while since I wrote some things down, my focus has shifted and I have my eye on new topics and ideas."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Day to day going through major growth in my day job, the last 18 months or so have changed me as a professional dramatically."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Next areas of focus:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"AWS serverless architecture"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"3D theory"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"System design"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Rust & WASM"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Testing"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This areas of focus are going to be my main focus for the next few months, by writing them down I hope I can be a little more accountable for what I am learning and writing about.
